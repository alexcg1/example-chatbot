14057,Can pets catch the cold?,"Last night I was drying my cat with a towel after shenanigans in the rain and she sneezed! 

Questions


Can cats/dogs/hamsters or other pets catch the cold? 
How quickly do they recover?

",14083,"Yes they can. The viruses that cause a cold include rhinoviruses (up to 80%), coronaviruses and influenza (together accounting for much of the remaining 20%) and a small percentage of adenoviruses. When discussing cross species transfer, influenza is the most important to discuss as it is a fairly common cause of the ""common cold"". 

Influenza A has humans, pigs, bird and horses as its host. Different influenza strains have different hosts. Influenza can recombine if two strains infect the same host (antigenic shift) and also mutate (antigenic drift). With a combination of these influenza can and has numerous times crossed the species barrier which has caused the major flu pandemics as well as swine and avian flu. It's this reservoir that makes these viruses so hard to eradicate. When we are the only host such as in polio virus, it is a lot easier. Pigs don't adhere to national flu guidelines. 

Comparing recovery times, all mammals are roughly similar although due to our slightly more evolved immune system as well as social factors of knowing what to do when we are ill we recovery very slightly earlier.

89709,Is the Common Cold an Immune Overreaction?,"It's my understanding that the majority of symptoms associated with the common cold (runny nose, inflamed sinus, slight fever) are essentially the result of the immune system's response.

I've never heard of someone dying of the common cold (unlike influenza), even in immune compromised people. As such, what damage would the cold virus inflict if there was no immune response? Would it be catastrophic?
",89712,"Can someone die of the common cold?

No. 
The common cold is a clinical syndrome restricted to upper respiratory tract involvement. By clinical syndrome, I mean it is the constellation of symptoms (rather than the consequence of a specific pathogen). As you mention, these symptoms are the result of the immune response, rather than tissue damage or compromised function as a direct effect of a pathogen or its toxin (e.g., the watery diarrhea in cholera).  

As defined (see, e.g., Cecil Medicine Ch. 369), this clinical syndrome cannot lead to death. 


  The common cold is an upper respiratory syndrome of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, frequently accompanied by sore throat, sneezing, and cough.


Can the viruses that cause the common cold cause death?

Yes. Many viruses that cause the common cold also cause other clinical syndromes that can cause death. This occurs when viral replication moves to the lower respiratory tract. As an example, influenza viruses are responsible for 25 - 30% of common colds (see Bennett, Principles and Practice of Infectious Disease, Ch.58). When it moves beyond the upper respiratory tract, influenza is responsible for substantial mortality. Other virus families that are responsible for both a common cold syndrome and lower respiratory tract syndrome in immunocompetent individuals (e.g., bronchiolitis, pneumonia) include parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and (rarely) coronavirus. Rhinovirus, responsible for 40-50% of common cold cases, is uniquely unsuited to lower respiratory tract involvement, because of its preference for the cooler environment of the nasal mucosa, replicating best at 33 C (Murray Medical Microbiology, Ch 56). However, in individuals with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), lower respiratory tract involvement does occur. There are a number of case series reporting death due to lower respiratory rhinovirus. This is an example.

Can the common cold lead to serious illnesses other than lower respiratory tract involvement?

Yes. Other morbidity can occur as a result of the immune response that produces the common cold syndrome. Rhinorrhea and congestion can progress to a viral rhinosinusitis, a separate syndrome with its own complications, or a secondary bacterial infection, which can lead to bacterial sinus involvement and/or bacterial lower respiratory tract infection. Otitis media is another common complication, especially in children, and has its own potential complications. Asthma (and, generally speaking, most lung diseases) can also be exacerbated by what would otherwise be a simple common cold and predisposes to lower respiratory tract involvement. Asthma does deserve special mention, because rhinovirus associated exacerbations can be fatal, but this is a consequence of asthma rather than a common cold syndrome. Further discussion of these syndromes are beyond the scope of the question, but are discussed briefly in the chapters referenced above.

89886,Air purifier agains bacteria and viruses?,"We would buy a mobile air purifier in our home. 

Against the smoke of the city, etc. 

It would have a HEPA + activated carbon filter. They are marketing it as: 


  ""filtration process captures 99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.1
  micron in size.""


and having also: 


  ""encapsulated ion particle charging chamber""


But the question: 

Would the mentioned filter+ion charger also help cleaning the air from bacteria and viruses? 

Ex.: ""Coronavirus/2019-nCoV"" is about ""Coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters of approximately 125 nm"" - but I just Googled it, not from an official source. And 0.1 micron is 100 nm. 

UPDATE: would it be more effective, if it would have UV-C light in the air purifier? 
",89887,"The aforementioned filter will filter microbes

Yes, it is routine practice to use microfiltration in labs to sterilize solutions from microbes. 0.2 micron filters will remove all typically-found bacteria most of the time, except for the odd bacteria here and there, though this is uncommon. 0.1 micron filters certainly remove all stray bacteria that may make it through upon a single 0.2 micrometer filtration. Here is a nice read on the appropriateness of 0.2 and 0.1 microfilters, which simply states that 0.2 micro filters are usually more appropriate since they additionally guarantee a better flow rate.

The aforementioned filter will NOT ensure filtration of viruses

These filters are not used, suitable nor effective for viruses, however. You ask specifically about the coronavirus. From a 2015 study:


  Coronaviruses are members of the Coronaviridae group and contain a
  single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome surrounded by a corona-like
  helical envelope (Ryan 1994). The SARS virus genome consists of 29,751
  base pairs. Approximately 41% of the genome is GC base pairs while 59%
  is TA base pairs. Coronaviruses have a size range of 0.08-0.15
  microns; with a mean size of 0.11 microns (see Figure 1).


This means 0.1 micron filters will not protect you from these viruses. They may help you reduce viral count in the air, which may of course be sufficient, but this would not be an adequate measure in a biological safety facility.

The cost-effectiveness of commercial air-purifiers for biosafety vs. pollution

On a advice-related note: I do not think air-purifiers are going to help you in a cost-effective manner to avoid viruses (e.g. Rhinoviruses that cause the common cold, for instance), lest you stay at home all the time. You expose yourself outdoors, and carry plenty of viruses indoors on your body and in your respiratory tract; these will bypass your filtration system on the daily. Being healthy and lucky enough to avoid exposure to viruses outside the house is still the best bet. I think an air purifier has a greater potential to help with smog and urban pollution, those particles are typically larger than the diameter of most microbes.

89929,Why are bats the source of dangerous coronavirus pandemics?,"Why do coronaviruses come from bats?

I mean, why precisely coronaviruses and not (for instance) herpesviruses?
It looks like bats host more zoonotic viruses (per species) than rodents, although they don't develop any sign of disease.

The article above says that rodents host more zoonotic viruses than bats overall (68 against 61), but at the same time most of the latest pandemics originated from bats.

It also seems that bats could be involved in the maintenance of ebola viruses.

My question is: why did these major pandemics originate from bats and not from rodents, although rodents host more zoonotic viruses overall?

We should also take into consideration that human-rodent interaction is usually more likely than human-bat interaction, except for people who consume bats (like Chinese people; this would (partially) explain why both SARS and 2019-nCoV developed in China).
",89944,"
  The preponderance of links between bat and human pathogens has led to a debate about whether bats disproportionately contribute to emerging viral infections crossing the species barrier into humans (26–30). Given the diversity of the Chiroptera order (Figure ​(Figure1),1), we may simply see more bat viruses because there are so many (>1,300) species of bats (31). However, even when accounting for the fact that they make up ~20% of extant terrestrial mammals, bats are overrepresented as reservoir hosts of pathogens with a high potential for spilling into human populations (32, 33). In fact, no known predictors that have been described to impact the likelihood of crossing the species barrier, including reservoir host ecology, phylogenetic relatedness to humans or frequency of reservoir-human contact, explain this pattern (32). Thus, why bats are such a frequent source of pathogenic human viruses remains a tantalizing mystery.

Related question: Why are bats the source of dangerous coronavirus pandemics?
",89975,"It's common for the reservoir host of a zoonotic virus to be tolerant of it. MERS coronavirus appears to cause mild or no disease in dromedary camels ( source ), but kills about 35% of confirmed infected humans. ( CDC ) Sin Nombre hantavirus seems to be mild in the deer mice that spread it, despite ~36% fatality rate in humans. ( source ) Mosquitoes are efficient vectors for flaviviruses like dengue and zika in part because they have adaptations we lack that protect them from the virus. ( source ) Also, human communities are host to several viruses: about 90% of people have a herpesvirus infection ( source ) with similar numbers for polyomaviruses. ( source ) Very few of these infected individuals show symptoms.
The wide prevalence of these asymptomatic infections shows that the virus is successful when it can replicate while the host remains healthy. In general, virus reproduction kills cells, and when cells die faster than the host can replace them, this causes symptoms up to and including death. The host's immune system supresses virus activity, and a virus that can't evolve ways to avoid immune supression will be wiped out. But if the virus gets so good at avoiding the immune system, it will kill the host, which is bad for the virus. So both host and virus tend to evolve to a point where the immune system wins most, but not all of the time. There is a lot more to it, but I'll stop here.

In conclusion, we don't really need to look for special properties of bats to explain their tolerance of coronaviruses, even though, as iayork points out, there are reasons to expect bats might be more resistant.
",Accepted,"I think that ""career in synthetic biology"" and ""involved in planning"" both express very vague ideas. There are significant differences in what you will be able to do with a Bachelor's, Master's or PhD, depending on what exactly you end up doing. 

I entered a PhD program in biology for no better reason than that I felt awed and fascinated with science and had done really well in science subjects as an undergrad. Grad school seemed like a natural extension of that effort. 

In retrospect, my motivations for pursuing a PhD were horribly naïve and easily the greatest challenge that I faced as a grad student was that of defining why I was there and where I wanted to go with my degree. So, to address the issue of vagueness in your question, my first piece of advice is to have a firmer idea of what you want to do. Plans will change, but simply having a plan (a real plan) might provide an anchor when you need one.

As to what you can do with the various degrees, I can't precisely answer your question, the way you've phrased it, but I can give you a general idea. 

A bachelor's degree in biology will not get you far in a lab setting. Among the lab techs I've worked with, even most of them have master's degrees. From what I've seen, this holds just as true for academia as for industry. 

It's a little unclear what you mean by ""planning"", but most of the admin that I work with, who are involved in planning our various projects also hold advanced degrees, typically in science, business or public health. I see a strong representation among the management at my institution (Columbia University) of PhD scientists, who left the bench for something less life-consuming, while still wanting to have a hand in research. These people are frequently grants managers or program directors. 

As I mentioned earlier, the lab techs around me generally hold master's degrees. When I was considering quitting my PhD program after the master's component, a friend in industry advised me against it, if I ever thought that I might seek work in industry. The picture that he painted was that in industry, a master's degree makes you overqualified for many of the tasks that you can expect to be hired for, but underqualified for significant future career advancement. 

Obviously, you shouldn't feel limited to academic vs industrial research tracks. There are plenty of other options out there. Maybe look up people's blogs that involve synthetic biology or whatever other topics of interest you might have to get a wider view of what people who have expertise in the subject are doing.

89958,Can Coronaviridae mutate into something as dangerous as Flioviridae?,"Can coronaviruses mutate to an extent to get as dangerous as fliovirusues such as Marburg viruses, Ravn or Ebola Zaire? 
",90540,"'Dangerous' is quite a subjective term, and can be defined in different ways.

Viruses vary in their pathogenicity, which is essentially the ability of the virus to cause a disease in a single individual. This can influence other factors, such as the case fatality rate, which is the proportion of people who die from the disease once they have contracted it. For example, the Ebola virus has a very high case fatality rate of up to 90%.

However, those aren't the only ways in which you could define 'dangerous'. We might also consider the total number of people that the virus can kill. This often isn't a linear relationship with the case fatality rate. Often, viruses with a high case fatality rate 'burn out' before than can inflict a global pandemic, because people die before they can spread the disease on to others. Vice versa, viruses with a relatively low case fatality rate, such as the Spanish Flu (2-3%) can be extremely 'dangerous' and kill millions of people. 

But there is no hard and fast rule, as the propensity of a virus to cause a global pandemic is influenced by many, many other factors. 

So to answer your question: is it possible for the Covid-19 to mutate into something as dangerous as Ebola? Well, if we are thinking about it's pathogenicity - Influenza A H5N1 (bird flu) had a case fatality rate of about 60%, which is pretty high for a flu virus. For context, the seasonal flu which has a case fatality rate of about 0.1%. I'm not an expert in Virology, so it would be great if someone with more knowledge could confirm this, but it seems very unlikely that the Covid-19 virus could acquire mutations to the degree where it would kill as high as 90% of the people who acquire it, like Ebola does. Ebola is a hemorrhagic virus, which is a totally different mechanism of pathogenicity to the Coronavirus family.  

It's plausible that Covid-19 could obtain mutations which allow it to transfer more quickly between humans. For example, we know that the Spanish Flu acquired mutations in hemagglutinin subtype which allowed it to be more transmissible between humans. Generally, Coronaviruses have relatively lower R0 rates than other disease (~2/3 compared to Measles which is 12-18). The total number of people killed by the Ebola outbreak was about 11,000. Covid-19 has already killed ~3000 (although the exact figure is hard to quantify), so it seems like on the global level, Covid-19 will be more dangerous than Ebola, if we consider the total number of people killed.

As viruses accumulate mutations due to errors during replication, this method is also used to generate genetic trees of the virus to analyze how it spreads, map routes of infection and also if the virus has been introduced to humans more than once (reference 2 has a nice overview on this topic).

The problem here is: You need to have some known references for comparision, if you have a completely new virus which has never emerged before, this will not help. For this reason there are projects ongoing which collect samples to identify yet unknown viruses (see reference 3)

Contact between humans and bats is certainly not a new phenomena, but there is more required for an emerging infection than a reservoir and a new host. There must be some bridge that allows a virus to cross a previously effective species barrier. For SARS, there was an intervening amplifying host, the palm civet.  We've now had long enough to study the molecular biology, so this is now quite well described:


  Once SARS-CoV had jumped from bats to civets, it underwent further mutations in civets. The first K479N mutation allowed SARS-CoV to jump from civets to humans and the second S487T mutation allowed SARS-CoV to transmit from human to human, leading to the severe SARS outbreak in 2002–2003.

Some viral surface proteins are important for adhesion and attachment, and misfolding these renders the virus inactive. The total breakdown of viruses is essentially due to the misfolding of their protein coat (the capsid).

There is no threshold dose of UV that does not cause cancer, as even a single short exposure may do the trick. Obviously, multiple exposures and longer exposures increase the chance.

90081,Why would a 2019-nCoV protein sequence in the NCBI database match a protein submitted in 2018?,"There seems to be a bit of a conspiracy theory brewing over some data in the NCBI database, and I don't have the necessary knowledge to make sense of it.

It basically goes like this:


Go to NCBI BLAST
Click on the big Protein BLAST button
Enter AVP78033 in the main search box and click BLAST
Click on the first result that shows a 100% match and click ""See 5 more title(s)"" in the first entry


This shows that the search is a complete match for a Bat SARS-like coronavirus protein from a 2018 research paper, for Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (which the NCIS site indicates is an alias for 2019-nCoV), and for Bat coronavirus from 29 Jan 2020.

My question is - why would a protein from Bat SARS-like coronavirus and 2019-nCoV be showing up as a perfect match for one another? Does this mean that 2019-nCoV might actually be a previously-discovered coronavirus that very recently started infecting humans? Or could it be that a recently collected sample from Wuhan was mis-identified as 2019-nCoV when it is actually the same coronavirus from the 2018 submission? 

Clicking around the links on that site seem to bring up dozens of similar but different pages that I don't have the knowledge to distinguish, but the Accession column from the search results described above contains a link to this page, which says that it is a provisional refseq and acknowledges that it is identical to the bat coronavirus:


  PROVISIONAL REFSEQ: This record has not yet been subject to final
              NCBI review. The reference sequence is identical to QHD43418.
              Annotation was added using homology to SARSr-CoV NC_004718.3.


Can somebody who actually understands these things please make sense of this?
",90082,"2019-nCoV is a virus that originated from the bat (at least this is the current hypothesis). It shows 96% squence similarity to the BatCoV RaTG13 sequence (see reference 1), showing its origin.

It still is 87,99% identical to the ""Bat SARS-like coronavirus"", which explains the hit you found and is not unexpected, as these viruses are very closely related (see reference 2). 

These viruses are closely related, so I wouldn't expect too many differences at all. Then envelope proteins can be critical for function/structure of the virus, so mutations there might occur less frequent. And if they occur, I would only expect few changes over time, so with this little time gone, probably no mutation is seen yet. Additionally, due to the redundancy caused by the codon degeneracy, not every mutation in the genomic material translates into changes in the protein.

Googling 'seagull rooftop nests' brings a decent amount of pictures of rooftop nests. 'Seagull nests' brings a lot of cliff-placed nests, rooftop and ground nests. I assume the choice depends mostly on food availability and predator population density. I remember in Spain a few years ago there was a big enough problem to appear on local TV news related to seagulls attacking people. They would nest on every roof and attack people that would go out on the balcony with a sandwich.

90168,How are lipid-coated mRNA-based vaccines transported into cells for expression?,"In CNN's video Scientist says Coronavirus vaccine could be ready by 2021 after about 00:25 'Robin Shattock, the Head of Mucosal Infection and Immunity at Imperial College London' says:


  We were able to access the sequence that was published by Chinese scientists and made globally available, which was a tremendous thing to do. And we went from that sequence to identifying part of the sequence that encodes for the surface proteins of the virus. And we’re using that sequence to manufacture our vaccine.
  
  We’re using a particular approach where we make a synthetic vaccine based on RNA, so essentially it’s essentially genetic code, we package that in essentially a lipid droplet, and use that to inject in a muscle; it expresses that protein, and the body recognizes that as foreign and it makes protective antibodies.


I'm assuming that this is mRNA and so once it reaches the cytoplasm of the vaccine recipients muscle cells it will be expressed and somehow returned to the cells' membrane where it will be recognized as foreign by passing lymphocytes.

Questions:


Is this basically correct as far as it goes? 
If so, what causes the lipid droplet to fuse with muscle (or other) cells in the first place?

",90605,"I can't give an authoritative answer on this because my PhD work was based on mRNA delivery using peptides instead of lipids, but many of the concepts are the same. I also don't have time to provide proper citations, but this is probably too much for a comment.

Anyway, mRNA is a very fragile molecule, it can be broken down extremely quickly in the blood by serum nucleases. Therefore we must protect the mRNA by mixing it with some other chemical, in this case a mixture of positively charged lipids. The positively charged lipids are attracted to the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the mRNA, and form a nanoparticle trapping the mRNA inside and hiding it from the nucleases. The lipids are often, but not always, PEGylated, which means that a molecule of polyethylene glycol (PEG) is attached to the lipid. The PEG groups form a layer on the outer surface of the nanoparticle that helps prevent protein binding.

These mRNA lipid nanoparticles are then injected into a patient. This will probably be an intramuscular injection so that the particles are most likely to be taken up by muscle cells. The exact mechanism explaining why lipid nanoparticles are attracted to cells isn't entirely clear, but it's likely a combination of electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nanoparticle and the negatively charged cell membrane and proteins that bind to the nanoparticle and are then recognized by receptors on the cell surface.

After the particle is taken up by a cell it is usually trapped inside a membrane-bound structure called an endosome. As the endosome matures it is acidified, and as the pH drops from about 7 to about 5.5 the nanoparticle is disrupted. The lipids that made up the nanoparticle can merge with the lipids that make up the endosomal membrane, disrupting that membrane and breaking open the endosome, allowing the mRNA to escape into the cytoplasm.

Once in the cytoplasm the mRNA will find a ribosome and produce protein. Just like you said, the protein in this case will be membrane bound and expressed on the outer surface of the cells for eventual immune recognition.

90287,Why would it be dangerous to consume cooked bats even if they are linked to viruses?,"(Not sure if this is the right SE for this question. I'm asking this here, because I'm looking for a biological answer, if one exists.)

This (potentially very naive) question is inspired by this news article: Bats for sale at Indonesia's wildlife market despite virus warning


  Bats, rats and snakes are still being sold at an Indonesian market known for its wildlife offerings, despite a government request to take them off the menu over fears of a link to the deadly coronavirus.


Why would the government request to take the meat of these animals off the market? Even if they're linked to the coronavirus, the virus presumably can be killed by cooking the meat prior to consumption. After all, protein denatures well before 100 degrees celsius, and once it denatures the organism should die. Conceivably the virus could affect the handlers of these animals prior to their being cooked, but not the consumers.

Some paragraphs later in the article illustrate my confusion:


  Restaurateur Lince Rengkuan -- who serves bats including their heads and wings stewed in coconut milk and spices -- says the secret is preparation.
  
  ""If you don't cook the bat well then of course it can be dangerous,"" she said.
  
  ""We cook it thoroughly and so far the number of customers hasn't gone down at all.""


Which is effectively what I've been thinking, but:


  ""We're also urging people not to consume meat from animals suspected to be carriers of a fatal disease,"" said Ruddy Lengkong, head of the area's government trade and industry agency.


How are these two seemingly-contradictory positions reconciled?
",90318,"Restaurateur Lince Rengkuan is correct - once the bat meat is cooked the coronavirus will die, and the meat is safe to consume.

The Indonesian government isn't imposing restrictions for biological reasons, but for other reasons; these other reasons are out of scope of this SE.
",Accepted,"The answer is incomplete dominance.

It can't be codominance, because codiminance involves both phenotypes being expressed in different parts of the organism: you would end up with red and yellow spotted flowers.

It obviously isn't complete dominance, because the red x yellow cross produces orange flowers.

Knowing that it has to be incomplete dominance or multiple alleles, we can examine what we would expect to see in either of these cases.

Multiple alleles

In the case of multiple alleles, each individual plant has two alleles out of a possible three. These alleles will also express some sort of dominance pattern over each other. Let's say, hypothetically, that the dominance pattern goes Red > Orange > Yellow. 

In this case, all of the yellow flowers would have a genotype of yellow/yellow. The orange flowers could be orange/yellow or orange/orange. Red flowers can be red/orange, red/yellow, or red/red. When performing the crosses between red and yellow, you would then expect some mixture of offspring, probably mostly red. If the dominance pattern was different, you would still expect to see some mixture of offspring. But instead we see only orange offspring.

Incomplete dominance

In this scenario, homozygote red individuals have a red phenotype, homozygote yellow individuals have a yellow phenotype, and heterozygous individuals have the mixed orange phenotype.

In this scenario, you would expect red x red to produce only red offspring, and the same goes for yellow x yellow, because both parents have to be homozygous. Orange x orange would produce offspring in a genotype ratio of 1:2:1, as is the case when you self-cross heterozygous organisms. Orange x red and orange x yellow will produce offspring in a 1:1 genotype ratio, as is the case when you cross a heterozygote with a homozygote. These are exactly the patterns we see, so we can conclude that the answer is incomplete dominance.

When medical professionals notice that a group of people with some characteristic in common, are being seen for a similar disease, they ask if there's a connection.

--A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019

You're more likely to follow up when the disease is unusual or severe, and when the connecting factor is unusual or suspicious. In this case, the severe pneumonia was presumably unexpected, and live animal markets always have potential for disease transmission. 

(In fact, it's quite possible that the virus had been circulating in the region for weeks before this cluster was noticed, and that previous cases had not been surprising enough to trigger the research needed to identify a new virus; though it's also likely that the medical personnel in Wuhan had noticed that there were an usually high number of pneumonia cases and were already looking for a connection.)

See also the answers to How did scientists discover HIV?. Old-fashioned epidemiology is always critical.

The same article explains how the virus was sequenced:


  Bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid samples were collected in sterile cups to which virus transport medium was added. ... RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid and culture supernatants was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. 


And isolated:


  ... supernatant from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid samples was inoculated onto the apical surface of the cell cultures. ...  After three passages, apical samples and human airway epithelial cells were prepared for transmission electron microscopy. ... 


So briefly, they took patient samples, grew them on cultured cells, used electron microscopy to check the kind of virus. They sequenced fluid (not cells, since the virus would be secreted into the fluid, making it a relatively pure source of virus RNA) and then sequenced using a standard high-throughput sequencing approach; knowing the likely kind of virus would make this easier but isn't essential. There would have been lots of human RNA in the sequence, but it's easy to bioinformatically separate that out and limit your analysis to the viral sequences. The virus isolate was also not essential for the identification; knowing the sequence is the critical information today. But having a virus isolate certainly makes all the subsequent work much easier.

This is pretty standard modern molecular biology, not an esoteric skill.
",Accepted,"Competitive inhibitor competes for the active site. Therefore it will interfere with the binding of the substrate thereby increasing the apparent KM. 

A strictly non-competitive inhibitor does not compete for the active site. It however inhibits the catalysis by reducing the available molecules of active enzyme, E0 (if it is a perfect inhibitor), thereby lowering the Vmax.

There can be mixed inhibitors too and there can be different kinds of mixed inhibition. For example an inhibitor that interferes with catalysis and can also compete for the active site. 

Depending on how you define KM, a non-competitive inhibitor may or may not change it. If such inhibitor can bind to the enzyme at non-active site and reduce its kcat, it changes the KM as well as Vmax in case of Briggs-Haldane kinetics.

Why could it be pleasurable

Why could it be harmful

In many species, the penis has spikes and stuff and is most definitely hurting the females. Here is a Drosophila penis



And here are penises of two dragonfly species



Here is a feline penis



By the way, according to wikipedia (could not find peer reviewed paper on the subject so take this with a grain of salt), some humans still have on remnants of those barbs you can still see on many feline penises left from our ancestor. They are called hirsuties coronae glandis. Here is a perfectly healthy (but I would tend to consider quite extreme) example of hirsuties coronae glandis



Some theory

There is a lot to say here and I only want to say a few words and hopefully you will go get more information by yourself.

So why do these species evolve these fancy and scary ""armed"" penises. In many species, it is a small investment for a male to make a baby (just mate and the job is done) but a big investment for the female (producing the egg, eventually even parental care, ...). Because the sex-ratio is always (assuming no group selection) pushed toward 0.5 (see this post and Fisher's principle), it happens that males end up with lots of free time looking for females (see Why are female not competitive for reproduction like males? and Bateman's principle). You might also want to read about sexual conflict.

Why would such penis evolve?

The reason vary among species. Here is a non-exclusive, non-exhaustive list of reasons:


In some species (e.g. nudibranch, damselflies)The goal is to remove the sperm from an eventual previous male so as to reduce sperm competition (Cordero-Riviera, 2016).
In some species, the goal is to damage the female reproductive track so that she will not subsequently mate with other males hence reducing sperm competition ().
In some species, the male can even leave toxic products in the female (Chapman et al., 1995).
In some species, females get severly harrassed by males for mating and rape is not unusual (e.g Drosophila). Some penile barbs and spikes can be used to get the female stuck in place. To avoid that the female can escape before the sperm has been delivered ()! That being said, in some circumstance such use of spiky penis might be beneficial to the female too. This non-peer reviewed article may bring some light.
In some species, the male can pierce through the female abdomen to deliver its sperm. This is called traumatic insemination.


In a classical experiment, Rice 1996 shows that there is an arm race between males and females. Race in which males increases their negative impact on female's reproductive organs and females protect themselves from it. The paper is free, is short, easy to read and has a pretty amazing experimental design. It is worth having a look at it.

Feeding the babies via the mother

I just want to point with other examples that sex does not have to be romantic in many species. In some species, the female eats the male after sex or even while having sex. To what I have heard (; please be cautious with this information), in some mantis prey, the male does not even release his sperm before the female has cut the male's head off. Why would the male do that?

A male that let himself get eaten by the females ensures that the female has lots of energy for taking care of her babies. Hence a male may increase his fitness by sacrificing himself to his partner.

Unfortunately, I don't know what press conference it was (I'm not sure if it was the Robert Koch Institute — it might also have been the Charité university hospital) and cannot find such a stated expectation on the internet.

Why would an expert express this expectation?

Is it because we're heading toward summer (at least where most COVID-19 cases have been reported), or is it a standard pattern, perhaps either due to people's immune systems or due to the virus evolving and becoming weaker? 
",90672,"While the data are much too sparse and noisy to give an answer about what is happening to COVID-19's virulence (the technical term for the ""deadliness"" of an infectious disease), or to forecast what will happen to its virulence in the future, there are indeed theoretical reasons that one might expect the virulence to decline in the future.

There is an entire theoretical literature on the evolution of virulence (e.g. see Read 1994, or see Wikipedia); Robert May and Paul Ewald are two researchers who contributed seminal ideas. The basic idea is that infectious 'organisms' (including viruses) may face a tradeoff between their ability to produce lots of infectious particles (e.g. by replicating faster within the host) and the length of time that they can stay in the host before it dies or activates immune defenses sufficiently to end the infection. In this case, some intermediate level of virulence may evolve.

Evolution of virulence in ways predicted by the theory has been observed in the real world in such diseases as myxomatosis (a viral disease of rabbits). The theory has also been suggested to apply in HIV and syphilis.

The actual forecast can depend on many details of the biology and epidemiology of a particular organism. If COVID-19 happened to have a higher-than-optimal virulence in humans at the time of emergence, we could expect its virulence to decline over time. It could also decline if epidemic control was applied in such as way as to differentially affect more-virulent strains; this has been suggested by Tang et al. on the basis of the pattern of mutations in different strains, although their logic has also been criticized on Twitter by an expert in genetic epidemiology, and now by a more official rebuttal by McLean et al. (with some back-and-forth discussion between the authors and critics).

This explanation doesn't include the possibility of host evolution, which is theoretically important but not really relevant to COVID-19 &mdash; it would only happen over many generations, and only if the epidemic was so severe that it was a significant overall cause of death or failure to reproduce ...

The bill of materials is daunting:


Two spoons
Willing test subject


In my case, the subject was my girlfriend at the time.

It is known that we use spectral effects to determine the elevation angle of a sound.  Our ears and our shoulders are known to shape the sound, emphasizing some frequencies and muting others.  Of course, this process is impossible to do if you don't know what the sound was ""originally.""  If you don't know what the sound was as it reached you, you can't figure out how much the ears have colored it.

For this experiment I picked two spoons, and verbally described what I was going to do.  I was going to click the spoons in various places and have her reach for them.  I intentionally did not click the spoons together in this demonstration because I did not want her to get to hear the spoons until the experiment started.

I first asked her to close her eyes.  I clicked the spoons in various places, and she identified which direction she thought it came from.  She was reliably accurate in left/right direction, because she could hear the time delays between the sound hitting her left and right ear.  However, her elevation angle was rather random.  There did not appear to be any pattern at all to it.

Then I asked her to open her eyes, and do a very boring version of this experiment.  With her eyes open, she of course was able to point to the clicking spoons 100% of the time.  (This was actually the hardest part, because it seems absurd to the test subject.  They start to think it's a trick).

Then, I had her close her eyes again, and repeat the experiment.  The results?  She was dead on every time.  Didn't miss a single one, both azimuth and elevation.

So what do I claim happened?  When we started the experiment, she did not know the frequency spectra of the spoons clicking.  As such, she could not effectively back out what transform her ears and shoulders were applying, and could not figure out elevation angles.  She could make some guesses, as a human that has heard things clacking together, but that was insufficient to accomplish the task.

In the boring second phase, she could now fuse the information she got from her eyes in with that from her ears.  Now she could determine what angle the sound was coming from with her eyes, figure out what the transform of her ears/shoulders should be, and back out what the ""true"" sound of the spoons was.

In the third phase, she now knew the ""true"" sound of the spoons, so whenever soundwaves hit her ears, she could use that knowledge to figure out what transform her ears/shoulders must have been applying, and figure out angles.

I used this to argue that we can hear with our eyes, but it might be more effective to say that the brain doesn't pay as much attention to the division between the 5 senses as we do when we talk about our sensory experience.  As far as it is concerned, it's all simply neural stimuli.  It will fuse these into one coherent image, and that is what really matters.

90718,How many times has SARS-CoV-2 mutated?,"According to 

Coronavirus has mutated at least once


  The novel coronavirus that has infected thousands of people across the
  world may have mutated at least once — meaning there may be two
  different types of the virus causing illnesses, a new study conducted
  by Chinese scientists suggests.
  
  Scientists with Peking University’s School of Life Sciences and the
  Institut Pasteur of Shanghai in a preliminary study found that one
  strain — type “L” —  of the virus was more aggressive and accounted
  for about 70 percent of the strains analyzed. The second — type “S” —
  was less aggressive and accounted for about 30 percent of analyzed
  strains.


But also several webpages theorized the virus has mutated before passing from animals to humans. 

This page What we know about the Wuhan virus says


  This virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses.
  Named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, they infect mostly
  bats, pigs and small mammals. But they mutate easily and can jump from
  animals to humans


and


  Where did the new coronavirus come from? The new virus likely came
  originally from bats, scientists say. It isn’t known exactly where or
  how it jumped to humans, though. Viruses from bats often infect
  another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to
  humans.


though


  Coronaviruses can also jump directly to humans, without mutating or
  passing through an intermediate species.


Is something more known about this? Is it possible the virus has mutated twice in a period of time of months?
",90720,"This question makes a number of incorrect assumptions and I don't have time to correct them. The short answer is that the virus has mutated probably hundreds of times since it entered humans in late 2019. 

The lower figure on the NextStrain.org ncov page, ""Diversity"", shows the known mutations that have been identified so far. As I look at it now, there are maybe 100-200 shown there, but that will change daily and I can't be bothered to count them.

Is it possible the virus has mutated twice in a period of time of months? Of course it is. That's what we expect from coronaviruses. It would be shocking if it did not. 

The default assumption (based on a vast amount of experience with coronaviruses and many other viruses) is that these mutations are neutral and do not affect the virus in terms of fitness, virulence, or transmissibility in any way; they are occasionally useful in tracking sources, but unless you have spent a lot of time looking at virus phylogenetic trees for several years, your interpretations of these mutations are almost certainly wrong.

An example of people making claims based on unfamiliarity with virus evolution is the ""two different types of the virus"" claim. That claim is addressed by MacLean and colleagues in their Response to “On the origin and continuing evolution of SARS-CoV-2”. Summary:

90732,Human Immune Response to COVID-19 Virus,"I have tried to find an answer to this but have not found anything after multiple attempts.

The question on the table is if the human body is able to produce an immune response to the COVID-19 virus if one has been exposed? This would apply most specifically to persons that have been tested positive but have ""survived"" (i.e. not having succumbed to the serious lung complications that have caused deaths for some persons). 

A follow on question that comes from this is if the human body is able to mount a suitable defense does the current practice of keeping people in quarantine for two weeks allow for this defense to reach full effectiveness? 
",90734,"We probably won't really know for certain until we have time to gather more data from survivors. However, infection with existing coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV, genetically very similar to the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2; ref. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0695-z) suggests that those who are infected and survive may develop temporary immunity (ref. https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/04/two-scenarios-if-new-coronavirus-isnt-contained/):


  The toll of a seasonal-flu-like coronavirus also depends on immunity — which is also scientifically uncertain. Exposure to the four endemic coronaviruses produces immunity that lasts longer than that to influenza, Webby said, but not permanent immunity. Like respiratory syncytial virus, which can re-infect adults who had it in childhood, coronavirus immunity wanes.
  
  “Everyone, by the time they reach adulthood, should have some immunity to some coronavirus,” said Tim Sheahan, a coronavirus researcher at University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health. But because it doesn’t last, older people can get reinfected. The elderly also have a higher death rate from coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, a pattern 2019-nCoV is following.
  
  “There is some evidence that people can be reinfected with the four coronaviruses and that there is no long-lasting immunity,” Dr. Susan Kline, an infectious disease specialist at of the University of Minnesota. “Like rhinoviruses [which cause the common cold], you could be infected multiple times over your life. You can mount an antibody response, but it wanes, so on subsequent exposure you don’t have protection.” Subsequent infections often produce milder illness, however.


It might also be possible that someone was infected with two different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and did not develop immunity from the first infection. But it could have also been a continuation of the first infection, or testing error. Without virus sequence data, it was not possible to determine what happened for certain (ref. https://www.wired.com/story/did-a-woman-get-coronavirus-twice-scientists-are-skeptical/):


  What could be worse than getting the pneumonia-like illness now known as Covid-19? Getting it twice.
  
  That’s what Japanese government officials say may have happened to a female tour bus guide in Osaka. The woman was first diagnosed with Covid-19 in late January, according to a statement released by Osaka’s prefectural government Wednesday. She was discharged shortly after, once her symptoms had improved. A subsequent test came back negative for the virus. Three weeks later she returned with a sore throat and chest pain and tested again. For a second time, she tested positive for Covid-19.
  
  News reports detailing the case raised the possibility that people may not be developing immunity to the new coronavirus, even after they’ve recovered. But several infectious disease specialists say there’s not enough data to support that conclusion. Another possibility is that the virus subsided and flared up again. (Some viruses tend to do that.) Or the test was simply wrong.


If someone was infected twice, comparing the genomic sequences of the virus over time would have helped determine that with more certainty.

90742,Role of Prevalence in Estimating Coronavirus Mortality,"Let there be a sample of 10,000 people.

100 of them have a fever. You test them for COVID19 and they all come out positive.
5 of them die, 9 of them end up in intensive care.
The estimated mortality is 5%, and estimated intensive care rate is 9%.
What about the 9,900 asymptomatic people who did no get tested?

Scenario A: All 9,900 asymptomatic people would test negative for COVID19.
Scenario B: All 9,900 asymptomatic people would test positive for COVID19 because of a combination of high rate of asymptomatic carriers and high false positive rate.

Scenario A: true mortality rate is 5% and true intensive care rate is 9%.
Scenario B: true mortality rate is 0.05% and true intensive care rate is 0.09%.
the numbers are fictitious, but the point is simple - we can't estimate mortality without knowing the prevalence

Question:

Where are we right now between scenario A and scenario B? Or put another way, are there any ongoing studies/reports which take into account this factor?
",90743,"I think you're talking (setting aside false-positive/low-specificity testing problems for the moment) about the difference between infection fatality ratio (IFR, fraction of infected people who die from disease) and the case fatality ratio (CFR, fraction of clinically defined ""cases"" who die from disease). The difference between these two depends completely, as you suggest, on the difference between the population that gets infected and the population that is defined as a ""case"" (which could vary a lot: is it people who have a cough? fever &amp; cough? request testing? are admitted to the hospital? are admitted to the ICU?).

Because most of the people aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship were tested (3063/3711), we can have a reasonably good idea of the fraction infected (unlike the usual scenario where most asymptomatic cases are never noticed). The authors of this (not yet peer-reviewed) study concluded that:


  the all-age cIFR on the Diamond Princess was 1.2% (0.38–2.7%) and the cCFR was 2.3% (0.75–5.3%)


(where 'c' in cIFR and cCFR stands for 'corrected'; these are estimates that account for the fact that we don't yet know the outcome for all patients).

sensitivity and specificity of testing (false positive/negative rates)
variation with/adjustment for age (discussed in the paper)
variation by medical/social context (e.g. Wuhan vs Iran vs places where cases are caught early and the medical infrastructure isn't overwhelmed)

90752,Ratio of bleach to water required to disinfect COVID-19?,"I am confused about the needed ratio of bleach to water required to disinfect COVID-19 from surfaces.

The guide on CDC states that: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html


  Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.  
  
  Prepare a bleach solution by mixing:  
  
  5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water or  
  
  4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water


This is a 2% ratio. My problem is that it is not clear what ""bleach"" means. Chemically I guess it's Sodium hypochlorite. What's not clear is that what is the strength of the solution I can buy in shops.

Wikipedia states that bleach in stores can be anything between 3-25%.

Does CDC recommend the final strength of Sodium hypochlorite : water to be 2% or ""bleach in stores"" : water to be 2% (which can be anything between 0.06% - 0.5%

Disregarding this confusing CDC direction: What is the scientific recommendation for the required sodium hypochlorite : water ratio needed for disinfecting COVID-19 from surfaces?
",92189,"Perhaps I can help answer your microbiology question which is really about SARS-CoV-2 which is an enveloped mRNA virus. There is a lot of misunderstanding about SARS-CoV-2 and the medical disease it causes, COVID-19. The confusion is understandable as this is a novel coronavirus with a high rate of transmission &amp; people around the globe are still in a learning curve about it. It's important to understand how to decimate SARS-CoV-2 whenever possible. I'm an RDN &amp; years ago I went to grad school on an Allied Health Traineeship thanks to citizens of the U.S.A. Although now retired, as well as having been a clinician, I'm a former prof. I believe in giving back to society which has supported me.

Many pieces in the press unfortunately use terms of SARS-CoV-2 and then COVID-19 interchangeably, which they should not. This adds to public confusion. Keep in mind that disinfection in this instance pertains to decimation of the virus SARS-CoV-2 per se.

Cleaning should precede disinfection. Disinfection is biocidal elimination on fomite surfaces of microorganisms, in this instance SARS-CoV-2. After applying disinfecting dilution be sure to allow it adequate action time and then allow surface to air dry.

When CDC says to use “5 tablespoons (aka 1/3 cup) bleach per gallon of water” or “4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water” that is in effect 1000 ppm. CDC guidance assumes household bleach concentration to be 5-6.25%, even though most NaOCl manufacturers int the U.S.A. went to 8.25% back around 2012-2013. Check any bottle you have (or box it came in) for the NaOCl concentration for that batch of bleach. When first manufactured concentration is higher, but over time actual available free chlorine level drops and adequate potency passed by 1 year out from manufacturing date. If stored at higher room temperature, cut that down to 6 months which is more realistic. Adequate 1000 ppm of NaOCl for enough time (minimum 1 minute) can kill SARS-CoV-2.  If the non-porous fomite surface happens to be a countertop where inadvertently later food might be placed on, then after first cleaning, then disinfecting, be sure to rinse with potable H2O, then use a sanitizing solution dilution and allow to air dry.

See: ""COVID-19 – Disinfecting with Bleach"" from Michigan State U Center for Research on Ingredient Safety which will explain how to read date code of manufacturing on a household bleach (NaOCl) bottle and how much bleach to add to cold water in order to reach what is effectively a 1000 ppm dilution if bleach is still ‘fresh enough’ aka adequate concentration in bottle as purchased. The bleach concentration bottle code information can be read as follows (quoted or paraphrased from article):
Example: code E619337.
●First two characters E6 identify the company facility that manufactured the bleach. 
●Second two numbers 19 tell the year the company manufactured the bleach.
●Last three numbers 337 tell the day of the year the company manufactured the bleach.
So, code E619337 tells us this bottle of bleach was manufactured at facility E6 in 2019 on the 337 day of the year (using a Julian calendar), which is December 3.
This bottle of bleach technically expires one year from December 3, 2019, so it needs to be used or disposed of by December 2, 2020. 
Similarly a  product code A420027 tells us the product was manufactured at facility A4 in 2020 on the 27 day of the year, which is January 27. The product expires one year from January 27, 2020, so it needs to be used or disposed of by January 26, 2021. 
Adjust the Julian calendar keeping in mind the year as 2020 is a leap year. 
From experience using test strips with bleach concentrate dilutions, often that expiration timeline is closer to 6 months (commercial settings open bottle only 1 month).

Actually both of these reactions (growing/polymerisation and shrinking/de-polymerisation) usually happen at the same time but with different speeds. These speeds depend on whether GDP or GTP is bound by the $\beta$-tubulin at the + end, the (relative) concentration of GTP-bound free monomers and other structural proteins.

90793,What's the evidence against SARS-CoV-2 being engineered by humans?,"A couple of colleagues suggested in a discussion that the virus that causes COVID-19 appears to be made by humans, since nature could not have produced such an efficient virus — that spreads so fast and whose patients are contagious quite some time before showing signs of infection.

Since my knowledge of biology is very limited, my only counterargument for such a conspiracy theory was along the following lines:


there is a consensus that the most probable source of the first infection was in an animal market in China.
since that animal market was actually composed of a plethora of animals belonging to various species (mixed with humans), a virus had a bigger chance of evolving a mutation that might infect an individual from another species (a thing that is way less unlikely in the wild since many of those animals do not sit close to each others or next to humans).


Clearly, I have made a little story that might be quite far away from how SARS-CoV-2 infected humans, so I am interested in a scientific arguments to support my cause.

Question: What are the main scientific arguments that can be used to debunk COVID-19 being engineered by humans?

Answers that also include explanations more accessible to laymen are greatly welcomed.
",90796,"At the moment, there is very little scientific literature about this, but I found two papers that address the problem and are fairly easy to understand. You can find them in the references. Reference 1 is probably the most interesting and is the basis for this answer.
Edit: It is also interesting to read reference 2 on the origin of SARS-CoV-2, the article also addresses some of the conspiracy theories.

As far as I can see, there are a few major points taken up by conspiracy theories.

1. SARS-CoV-2 leaked from a lab, in which research on the Bat CoV (RaTG13) was done:

Unlikely, since both viruses share only around 96% sequence homology which translates into more than 1100 sites where the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 viruses is different from RaTG13. The mutations are distributed throughout the viral genome in a natural evolutionary pattern, making it highly unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 is a direct descendant from RaTG13. For comparison, the original SARS-CoV and the intermediate host palm civet SARS-like CoV from which it originated shared 99.8% sequence homology, showing a much closer relation.

2. The S (spike) protein from bat SARS-CoV cannot be used to enter human cells via the human ACE2 receptor and therefore has been adapted in the lab:

This is untrue, since a 2013 study of a novel bat corona virus was published showing the ability of the virus to enter cells via the ACE2 receptor. See reference 3 for details.

3. The spike protein of SARS-CoV contains a unique inserted sequence (1378 bp) located in the middle of its spike glycoprotein gene that had no match in other coronaviruses:

As shown in reference 4, the sequence comparision of the SARS-CoV-2 with closely related other corona viruses shows that this sequence is not unique to the new virus but is already present in older strains. It shows some difference due to inserted mutations.

4. The claim that SARS-CoV-2 contains four insertions from HIV-1:

The paper claiming this has now been retracted due to severe criticism, and additionally a renowned HIV expert published an analysis (reference 5) demonstrating that the HIV-1 claimed insertions are random rather than targeted.

5. The claim that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is completely man-made:

To design such a ""weapon grade"" virus in the lab, the design would usually start from a known virus backbone and then introduce logical changes (for example, complete genes from other viruses). This cannot be seen in the genome of the virus, rather you see randomly distributes changes throughout the genome coming from virus evolution and not directed cloning. It is more likely that this virus originates from the recombination of a bat CoV (to which it is closely, but not directly related) and another, not yet known CoV in an intermediate host, like the palm civet for the 2003 CoV.

",Accepted,"This is a great question.

I'm going to hypothesize here because I haven't had a chance to test my theory and I'm afraid that by the time I get around to it, I may forget about this question.

The real question is, what is the variable that makes the thrombin time act differently than what you would assume? I’d wager the answer is temperature.

Protimes are performed at 37 degrees in order to simulate the in vivo environment, but also because most coagulation factors aren't active at room temp, or at least they are very slow-acting at room temp. Heating the environment speeds this process up so the test doesn't take all day.

Now, we know if you take a tube of warm normal plasma and add calcium and thrombin to it, it clots right away, right? But this is a problem because the thrombin time is a quantitative assay and we need it to be sensitive, especially for those super old-school clinicians who use it to monitor heparin instead of a more modern test like the APTT or Xa inhibition. We need to be able to tell the difference between a patient that’s gotten a bolus of heparin and a direct thrombin inhibitor. So, if you remove the heat, you slow down the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and in the process you stretch the calibration curve, effectively increasing the sensitivity of the test. But this also has the effect of slowing down the conversion to where it takes 14–18 seconds rather than one or two.

If you change your test setup to have the thrombin reagent heated, my hunch is that your analyzer will give an error because the sample will have clotted by the time the analyzer reaches minimum threshold time. Or better yet, try this experiment on a fibrometer. I don’t have access to one so I can’t try it out as I’d like to.

I’d be interested in discussing this with any other experts out there, especially those that have played around in the coag lab. I may have occasion to test this out in the coming weeks; I’ll try to do it and update my answer with my results.

",Accepted,"Here I will assume we are talking about eukaryotic sequence specific transcription factors (ssTFs) and try to answer your first and part of the second question. There is in any case not definitive answer yet.

An estimate of ssTFs genes in humans is given in the 2009 Nature Reviews Genetics paper by Vaquerizas, JM et al, A census of human transcription factors: function, expression and evolution.

An excerpt from the abstract:


  Here, we present an analysis of 1,391 manually curated sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, their functions, genomic organization and evolutionary conservation.


The numbers are somewhat higher now. Wingender et al. have counted 1,558 human genes in their TFClass database 2013 NAR paper. In their 2014 NAR paper they included 1,557 human, 1,147 mouse and 1,105 rat orthologs.

Another way to look for this information is to see the number of entries listed in TF databases, like for example JASPAR. This has the advantage of including other species. However, the coverage here depends on the availability of position weight matrices (PWMs) for the binding specificities. Many uncharacterized TFs may not be found.



To try to answer your third question, that is, what is the proportion of TFs in the different species, a naive approach would be to divide the number of predicted TFs by the number of predicted genes in the target genome. For example, taking the latest estimates above with the predicted number of coding genes from Ensembl database (version 78) will return these percentages:

# Human
100 * 1557 / 20364 = 7.64%
# Mouse
100 * 1147 / 22606 = 5.07%
# Rat
100 * 1105 / 22777 = 4.85%


This suggests humans have a slightly higher proportion of TFs than rodents. However, these differences are not too big and may be dependent on the accuracy of the different estimates on TFs and gene numbers. An in itself, these numbers are not so interesting.

A much more interesting question is whether TF families have expanded more or less in different species (that is, whether the number of  proteins within each family has increased, regardless of the proportion to the total number of genes in the genome). I could find at least one paper where this has been done systematically for several eukaryotic species, covering animals, plants and fungi, and focusing on TFs common to the ones found in plants. The main conclusion of the paper is that some TFs families have expanded more in plants than in other organisms. Quoted from the abstract:


  To investigate if differences exist in the expansion patterns of TF gene families between plants and other eukaryotes, we first used Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) TFs to identify TF DNA-binding domains. These DNA-binding domains were then used to identify related sequences in 25 other eukaryotic genomes. Interestingly, among 19 families that are shared between animals and plants, more than 14 are larger in plants than in animals. After examining the lineage-specific expansion of TF families in two plants, eight animals, and two fungi, we found that TF families shared among these organisms have undergone much more dramatic expansion in plants than in other eukaryotes. Moreover, this elevated expansion rate of plant TF is not simply due to higher duplication rates of plant genomes but also to a higher degree of expansion compared to other plant genes.

90869,Viral mutation rates and replication,"TL;DR

What's the relationship between the following?


Mutation rates (expressed as ""mutations per year"" for a virus like e.g. COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). E.g. this article mentions ""The rate looks to be about 24 mutations per year""
Actual virion replication error rates in a single host cell, measured as e.g. error rates per released virion from the infected cell, i.e. (# of mutated released virions) per infected cell.




Assumptions

I would assume that mutations happen at a single virion-cell level because there are differences in e.g. nucleotides in RNA  between:


the virion infecting a cell (e.g. ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2)
the released virions from that same single cell


If so, wouldn't one argue that:


replication errors (at the nucleotide and thus released virion level) can easily happen, potentially billions of times during the infection of a single host organism
there is no ""single successful"" mutation or RNA variant within a host, rather, we have a distribution of RNAs, many of which could be simultaneously transmitted to another host organism?


Further context

I quote from e.g. this paper:


  On a per-site level, DNA viruses typically have mutation rates on the order of 10E-8 to 10E-6 substitutions per nucleotide site per cell infection (s/n/c). RNA viruses, however, have higher mutation rates that range between 10E−6 and 10E−4 s/n/c


Again, wouldn't that mean that a single host could 1) easily generate many mutations of the same virus and 2) pass most of those uniquely generated mutations to another host? If so, how come we can simply say ""24 mutations (over time) per year""? 
",90998,"Since no one else has done so, just gonna expand on what occurred here in the comments (mostly from @Alex Reynolds):

tl;dr: natural selection exists.

Longer version:


Mutations/replication errors/whatever will happen in the creation of new virus particles within a host cell. There is some distribution of number of mutational events that will occur as a function of the number of new RNA molecules created per cell and the replication error rate. Some subset of these RNA molecules will be packaged into new particles, yielding a new generation of viruses that get a chance to infect. Yes, this is potentially a large number of new mutations per infection event.
Some large proportion of these new particles will contain non-functional RNAs, due to inactivating mutations of one kind or another. Most of the new mutations will be worse at being a virus than the originally infecting virus (their immediate parent). So therefore, they will be outcompeted by non-mutated forms.
Among all those viruses which continue successfully infecting throughout the course of a year, on average we observe 24 substitution mutations in the genome over the course of that year. Every transmission chain included in the group of viruses at the end of the year must have remained viable for infection of hosts. In other words, it has survived natural selection.


In population genetics, this phenomenon is known as ""mutation-selection balance""- e.g. new mutations arise in the population at a rate that is limited by the action of natural selection (at equilibrium).

Genotype-phenotype maps

What of course I am leaving unstated is exactly why ""...new mutations will be worse at being a virus than the originally infecting virus...""

This is very hard to predict in many cases. In some cases it is very obvious why a mutant is bad at being a virus, if e.g. an essential gene is deleted from the RNA genome. But for many single mutations we don't really understand what their effect will be on virus function, we just observe that they drop out of the population due to negative selection. 

If you are interested in this question, I recommend looking into genotype-phenotype maps. I know Jesse Bloom has done some work on influenza in this field, here is one example of such a paper. It is generally extremely laborious to do this kind of work, so relatively little is known about the functional effect of any specific mutation in any specific genome.

Hope it is helpful to have all that written out.

Degradation/clearance rate of antibiotic

90870,Can COVID-19 affect a person a second time?,"I keep hearing people are recovering from COVID-19 virus. Is there any chance that same person can become infected with COVID-19 for a second time? 
",90871,"Short answer: Although there are some reports on this, it is pretty unlikely. It is more likely that patients where released too early from hospital, developed further symptoms later on and got worse, was re-hospitalized, tested again for SARS-CoV2, which was positive and counted as re-infected. 

Another possibility is that a false negative test happened, when people got re-tested later the test was positive again and the patient was counted as re-infected. Given the rising number of cases worldwide this should become evident pretty soon, if this is a real problem and not an artefact. For the moment, I don't think there is enough evidence for the re-infection of the same patient in such a short time period. If this holds, future will tell.

Long answer: There is now an experimental paper, which infected rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV2, tested if the infection was similar to humans happening in the upper airways (which it was), and re-infected the animals after 28 days with a really high dose of virus (which is much higher than what comes around in our environment), with none of the macaques getting re-infected or showing pathological signs of the infection. See reference 1 for details.
This article has its limitations with small sample size and the general questions if the chosen animal model is really comparable with human. 

Additionally it looks very much like that patients who are recovering don't shed infectious virus anymore. The PCR test however does not discriminate between infectious virus and plain virus RNA, so it is most like much longer positive than people are infectious. They also show the rapid appearance of specific antibodies, which would at least temporarily protect against a re-infection. See reference 2 for a nice summary and reference 3 for the original article.

",Accepted,"Neurons communicate electrochemically. That is, when a signal arrives to a neuron it fires a series of electrical signals, called action potentials.
Action potentials are depolarization events that propagate along the neuronal membrane, down to the neuronal terminal. 
The terminal of a neuron is (with some exceptions) in contact with another neuron, via a structure called synapse.
When the depolarization arrives at the terminal, it allows the entry of calcium, which then mediates the release of a chemical substance, a neurotransmitter into the synaptic space. Finally, neurotransmitters act on the postsynaptic neuron, by binding to specific receptors on its cell membrane and can either stimulate it, in which case the postsynaptic neuron will fire more and release more of its neurotransmitter or inhibit it, in which case the opposite happens.

The textbook example of a stimulatory neurotransmitter is glutamate, and the inhibitory one is GABA1.

In various areas of the brain certain neurons are constantly receiving inputs from GABAergic afferents. This means that those neurons are constantly receiving a GABA stimulus that inhibits them, and are thus under a constant inhibitory tone. This will prevent their firing until a sufficiently potent stimulatory stimulus arrives or until the inhibitory tone is somehow released (for instance if the inhibitory GABAergic afferents are themselves inhibited by some of their own afferents).

https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&amp;id=CP-2009-PI-00595-3

Other viruses don't express these specific enzymes, and even if they have similar enzymes they may not interact the same way with the drug. Even within the herpesvirus family, the drug is not equally effective against every virus.

Coronaviruses are RNA viruses, so even though the drug is not effective for DNA viruses outside the herpesvirus family, coronaviruses are definitely not going to be affected because they don't even have a DNA polymerase to inhibit.

https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036/5775463

It is mentioned in the paper that:


  Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between
  SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the
  difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between
  the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated.


Their results highlight evolutionary changes in the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These developmental variations have a spike in changes to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs

How do they define S and L variations?

They did population genetics on 103 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
These two major types are well defined by two SNPs which show complete linkage across the viral strains.

It also important to mention that SARS-CoV-2 was found to have 96.2% similairty to a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13) but not very similar to SARS-CoV (79%) or MERS-CoV (50%).

How do we know that there's two type?

We know there's two types because from the 103 sequenced genomes two SNP locations show significant linkage. These are SNPs at location 8,782 (orf1ab: T8517C, synoniumous) and 28,144 (ORF8: C251T, S84L).

If you have a ""CT"" (as in base pairs) haplotype SARS-CoV-2 you've got the L-type (""L"" type because T28,144 is in the codon of Leucine). Otherwise, if you've got a ""TC"" haplotype you have the S-type (C28,144 is in the codon of Serine).

They found that S-type is the ancient (less aggressive version) by aligning it with other older viruses. In fact for each variant of the virus the ancestral state was inferred by alignments of SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512), RaTG13, and GD Pangolin-Cov.

So to be more precise on my answer for finding S and L types. You sequence the genome of an infected individual (you can find these online on NCBI) align it with the current reference sequence (MN908947, NC_045512), look at the SNPs and figure if they have a ""CT"" or ""TC"" haplotype to determine S or L type.
",Accepted,"Epigenetic marks are reversible (you might be aware of induced pluripotent cells). Many animals can regenerate organs with high tissue complexity (such as a limb) and this involves de-differentiation in some species (Sandoval-Guzman et al., 2014). Even otherwise, cells can respond to extracellular/environmental cues to modify their epigenetic state (for e.g. EMT involved in wound healing). I would still consider epigenetic marks to be more ""stable"" than simple regulatory mechanisms.

Only way for a cell's identity to actually become 'locked in' is by genetic changes. The maturation of lymphocytes (especially the B-cells), would be a good example. These genetic changes happen via V(D)J recombination, class-switching recombination and somatic hypermutation.

As humidity increases, the size of water droplet is larger which settles out of the air quickly. This the reason why influenza-like viruses spread more in winter season.

The SARS CoV2 (strain of coronavirus presently causing COVID 19 disease) has the basic reproduction number (R0) approximately 3, which means each infected person can pass virus to about 3 other people. And researchers have found by increasing temperature by one degree Celsius and one percent increase in relative humidity decreases this R0 value by 0.0383 and 0.0224, respectively.

90960,How are antibodies specific for a disease detected in the blood if everybody produces a different antibody for the same antigen?,"To break the title down into parts: 


There exist serology tests that detect the amount of an antibody (Ab)
against a specific pathogen/antigen.
Every human produces their own Ab for a specific antigen by
(relatively) random combination of different gene segments in their B
cells, until one that recognizes the pathogen is found and produced
in massive amounts.
One portion of every Ab is constant, whereas the portion that
recognizes the antigen is variable. Even for antibodies (in different
humans) that recognize the same antigen, albeit to a lesser degree.


What exactly does an antibody titer/serology test detect in the blood so that it can accurately measure the amount of antibodies against a specific antigen? I am assuming they use antibodies against the antigen-binding/variable portion of an antibody. But if the variable region differs from person to person, how can a universal antibody (to be used in serology tests) against it be generated? 

Is the variable region not that variable, so that any lab-generated antibody against any functional antibody against a virus works well enough for an accurate measurement of antibodies against that virus? But even so the concept sounds hard to believe since even a single antigen can have multiple epitopes, and one person might have an Ab for epitope 1 of antigen X, while the other would have an Ab for epitope 2 of antigen X. And they would still be immune to the same virus, while a universal Ab titer test for the virus would be unable to detect antibodies from one of them.

Do they perhaps employ multiple lab-generated antibodies against most of the possible variations of human-generated antibodies in the tests?
",90963,"Specific antibodies are typically detected using ELISA.

The way you make a test for an antibody to a particular pathogen is not by using secondary antibodies to the specific part of the target antibody, but by using the antigen.

Different kits work differently, but the general idea is that you have antigen stuck to a surface, you put the sample on that surface. If there are antibodies to the antigen, they stick to it. Then you wash everything away and add a tagged antibody that binds to generic human antibodies.

  “Coronaviruses aren’t new, they’ve been around for a long, long time and many species - not just humans - get them,” he explained. “So we know a fair amount about coronaviruses in general. For the most part, the feeling is once you’ve had a specific coronavirus, you are immune. We don’t have enough data to say that with this coronavirus, but it is likely.”

",Accepted,"The thing about sleep is that there is no ""one size fits all"". Think about it, if we are all biochemical different, then why would we all need the same amount of sleep? Why would all of our sleep cycles last the same amount of time? 

I was once a severely insomniatic person. I would worry about not getting that perfect eight hours of sleep that everyone talks about being so important, and despite trying my hardest to get eight hours of sleep it would never happen. I would either get no sleep at all, or I'd sleep in and get over twelve hours of sleep.

One day I was talking with my professor who specialized in sleep, and he suggested that I aim for four or five hours of sleep and to see how I start to feel. He also said to pick a specific time that I want to wake up everyday. Oddly enough, it fixed my problems. I can now go an entire day without thinking about how tired and fatigued I am.

So to answer your question, it does not matter. Wake up when you need to wake up, and go to bed when you are feeling tired. If you find that you feel good throughout the day having only slept 6 hours, then only sleep six hours. If you feel tired throughout the day, then you might need more sleep.

Your body will ""tell"" you if you need more or less sleep. But you need to listen to it.

Polyadenylation is initiated by binding of CPSF (Cleavage and Polyadenylation specificity factor) after its binding to the AAUAAA motif.
From the introduction of this article:


  CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificityfactor) binds to the
  AAUAAA hexamer via its 160-kDa subunit and possibly its 30-kDa subunit
  (Keller et al., 1991; Murthy &amp; Manley,1992; Jenny et al.,1994;
  Barabino et al.,1997). CstF (cleavage  stimulation  factor) binds to
  the U- or G/U-rich element downstream of the cleavage site, and
  stabilizes the binding of CPSF to the AAUAAA sequence of the pre-mRNA
  (reviewed in Colgan &amp; Manley,1997; Wahle &amp; Kuhn,1997).


Any alteration in the CPSF binding site will lead to reduced polyadenylation efficiency. Polyadenylation efficiency also depends on other factors such as secondary structure and presence of proximal CstF sites.

91032,Roughly speaking how stable are short sections of single-stranded RNA in exposed environments compared to double-stranded DNA?,"A search following a recent news item led me to a CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report for 23 March 2020 which says in part:


  SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified on a variety of
  surfaces in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic
  infected passengers up to 17 days after cabins were vacated
  on the Diamond Princess but before disinfection procedures
  had been conducted (Takuya Yamagishi, National Institute of
  Infectious Diseases, personal communication, 2020). Although
  these data cannot be used to determine whether transmission

Identifying bits of RNA does not imply a surface is infectious and that's not what I am asking about here. 

This reminded me of answer(s) to Was 14,000+ year old DNA “laying around in cave dirt” protected from degradation, or is it just naturally this robust? which explain that small fragments of DNA can be quite stable in some environments; in some places on Earth the DNA in the soil can be ten thousand years old.

",91084,"The main difference in stability is due to the very high amounts of RNase in pretty much all fresh biological materials. Naked RNA is easily degraded by just touching it with skin. The first step in most RNA extractions is often to add an RNase inhibitor.

  The extraction of RNA in molecular biology experiments is greatly complicated by the presence of ubiquitous and hardy ribonucleases that degrade RNA samples. Certain RNases can be extremely hardy and inactivating them is difficult compared to neutralizing DNases. In addition to the cellular RNases that are released, there are several RNases that are present in the environment. RNases have evolved to have many extracellular functions in various organisms.

",Accepted,"I don't know much about the evolution of thoughts on the subject but I would suppose that the estimate of 100,000 genes is probably caused by the one gene - one enzyme/protein ideas


  The one gene–one enzyme hypothesis is the idea that genes act through the production of enzymes, with each gene responsible for producing a single enzyme that in turn affects a single step in a metabolic pathway. 


The idea that genes are affecting cell functions via the protein that they code for is not so outdated. However, the idea that a gene codes for a single unique protein is a little outdated.

In reality a single gene can code for several different proteins via a mechanism called alternative splicing.


  Alternative splicing, or differential splicing, is a regulated process during gene expression that results in a single gene coding for multiple proteins. In this process, particular exons of a gene may be included within or excluded from the final, processed messenger RNA (mRNA) produced from that gene. Consequently, the proteins translated from alternatively spliced mRNAs will contain differences in their amino acid sequence and, often, in their biological functions [..]. Notably, alternative splicing allows the human genome to direct the synthesis of many more proteins than would be expected from its 20,000 protein-coding genes.


The original estimate of the number of genes was hence probably alined with the observed number of proteins by assuming that there is a one-to-one function from gene to protein (as by the one gene - one protein hypothesis).

91094,What are the difficulties/challenges against developing a coronavirus vaccine?,"Multiple groups of scientists are trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine but they are not yet being fruitful. What challenges or difficulties are there in the process that slowing down and/or causing failure in development of vaccine?
",91108,"There are multiple challenges presented, and many of those are not limited to coronavirus vaccine.

As mentioned above, it just takes time. Before a vaccine can be used in patients, clinical trials must be performed to validate the safety and efficiency of the vaccine candidate. A Clinical trial includes three phases, which again, just takes time.

But to really answer your question, what are some challenges of developing a vaccine?

To begin with, from the perspective of lab research, we first need to develop a vaccine candidate. What protein on the virus should we take as an antigen? There are many many proteins on the virus, and for CoV, we know it is a protein called Spike protein. It is the neutralizing target on the virus. Which means, when an antibody bound to this site, it could prevent the virus from infecting the cells. Okay, then we have to know, do we need to do something to this protein to make a vaccine? For example, when we try to manufacture this protein into a vaccine, what if the protein is degraded? Or it somehow becomes a 'bad' protein that simply cannot stimulate immune responses in human? These are just some examples of roadblocks of developing vaccine.

Let's suppose we finally work those out. Then what's next? Each candidate vaccine needs to be tested in animals before going into human clinical trial. This step is time-consuming.

Now we are finally ready to start clinical trials. According to FDA, the vaccine for human trials (also for each drug) needs to be produced under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). It's basically a standard operating procedure to make sure that the vaccine candidate can be manufactured in a large-scale, quality-controlled manner. There are many many challenges, like how to purify the protein? How to scale-up production. This is partly of the reason why the first vaccine in trial in USA is an mRNA, and in China is a DNA, both of which does not require complicated protein purification.

As you can see, the list of challenges can go on and on. But there are scientists and doctors working diligently on it. Hopefully we'll get there.
",Accepted,"A vaccine needs to be able to neutralize the virus (bind to it and masking from entering the cell) with high affinity. Now the virus is a large complex structure, so it is not immediately clear how to design a vaccine that can achieve that.

Screening antibodies from recovered patients might be a good idea, but it takes effort and time. What is more, the antibodies isolated from those patients may not be optimal for a vaccine, and some rational design based on those antibodies might be needed.

Another challenge is how to get a sustained level of vaccine proteins in the human body. The cutting-edge in the field right now is to use mRNA instead of proteins. You can read something about Moderna, which spearheaded this effort in the pandemic. But we still do not know what those RNAs are doing and where they are going in the body, so it takes many experiments and creativity to send those mRNAs into the human body so it can function properly.

To make a vaccine, you also need very strict production standard known GMP to make sure that the product is clean, pure and safe. This is not very easy and not every lab in the world can do.

",92243,"Question


  “Are there viruses that infect plants that can mutate to infect
  humans?”


Answer

None appear to have been reported so far. It is difficult to provide supporting evidence for an assertion that they do not exist, but a recent review on the relationship between plant and animal viromes does not include any examples, and our general understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses infect organisms and cells suggest that this is unlikely. There are, however, examples of plant viruses replicating in the insect vectors that transmit them.

Evidence

In 2011 Dolja and Koonin of the NIH published a review in Current Opinion in Virology 1 322-331 entitled Common origins and host-dependent diversity of plant and animal viromes. In this they considered: 


  “…three distinct scenarios for the origin of related viruses of plants
  and animals: i) evolution from a common ancestral virus predating the
  divergence of plants and animals; ii) horizontal transfer of viruses,
  for example, through insect vectors; iii) parallel origin from related
  genetic elements.”


The very fact that there was a need to argue for a relationship indicates the assumed distinction between animal and plant viruses, and indeed they write:


  “…plants are not known to support reproduction of dsDNA viruses and
  retroviruses.”


The only reference in the whole article to an actual biological relationship between animal and plant viruses is the following:


  “Strikingly, viruses of the order Mononegavirales and the family
  Bunyaviridae… can also reproduce in their arthropod vectors.”


The paper referenced in support of this statement is by Hogenhout et al. and was published in the Annual Review of Phytophathology (2008) 46 327–359, and is entitled Insect Vector Interactions with Persistently Transmitted Viruses. From this it emerges that there is a class of plant viruses called persistent propogative viruses which replicate in the circulation of their insect vectors, in contrast to most types of circulative viruses. The insects involved include the leafhopper (illustrated below in Fig 1 from that review) and the thrip.



Schematic representation of persistent virus transmission by a leafhopper. Viruses that are transmitted in a circulative persistent manner do not replicate in the insect and usually enter the salivary glands from the hemolymph. In plants, replication of circulative viruses is frequently restricted to the phloem tissues. In contrast, most propagative viruses replicate in several plant tissues and in different organs of the insect vectors ( yellow arrows) and may enter the salivary glands either from the hemolymph or from other connecting tissues, e.g., the nervous system or trachea. 

It is not clear to me whether the virus is in any way detremental to the insect vector — certainly it is not the primary target of the virus, and replication can be regarded as allowing it to survive longer before the insect transmits it to the plant.

Today insects, tomorrow people?

The very fact that persistent propogative insect viruses can replicate in their animal vectors raises the question whether the insects could somehow transmit them to human beings. In an answer to a different question on whether insect pathogens can infect humans I have argued that the absence of examples in situations where people come into close contact with insects and the  difference in anatomy and molecular structure of cell membranes makes this unlikely. In the present case we are not even talking about an insect pathogen, but a plant pathogen.
",Accepted,"When you travel to different time zones, your circadian clock will be off (incorrect). The reason your circadian clock will be off is because your body has adapted to the time zone you are from. When you enter a new time zone, your circadian clock will still be functioning on the old the time zone. If the time zone difference is $\pm 12$ hours, this is a huge adjustment.

However, your body takes inputs from the environment. That is, you may see it is day light when your body is under the impression it is evening. Your circadian clock is controlled by your master clock located in the hypothalamus. As you take in these external inputs that counter your circadian clock, a group of nerve cells called the suprachiasmagic nucleus will slowly make the master clock adjustment [1]. This resetting can take a few days.

In the case of 70% isopropyl alcohol, there are SDSs/MSDSs out there that will tell you what potential health effects are. Here's one example for 70% isopropyl alcohol:


  Potential Health Effects
  
  Eye: Produces irritation, characterized by a burning sensation, redness, tearing, inflammation, and possible corneal injury. May cause transient corneal injury. In the eyes of a rabbit, 0.1 ml of 70% isopropyl alcohol caused conjunctivitis, iritis, and corneal opacity.
  
  Skin: May cause irritation with pain and stinging, especially if the skin is abraded. Isopropanol has a low potential to cause allergic skin reactions; however, rare cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been reported. May be absorbed through intact skin. Dermal absorption has been considered toxicologically insignificant. The cases of deep coma associated with skin contact are thought to be a consequence of gross isopropanol vapor inhalation in rooms with inadequate ventilation, rather than being attributable to percutaneous absorption of isopropanol per se.
  
  Ingestion: Causes gastrointestinal irritation with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. May cause kidney damage. May cause central nervous system depression, characterized by excitement, followed by headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and nausea. Advanced stages may cause collapse, unconsciousness, coma and possible death due to respiratory failure. Aspiration of material into the lungs may cause chemical pneumonitis, which may be fatal. The probable oral lethal dose in humans is 240 ml (2696 mg/kg), but ingestion of only 20 ml (224 mg/kg) has caused poisoning.
  
  Inhalation: Inhalation of high concentrations may cause central nervous system effects characterized by nausea, headache, dizziness, unconsciousness and coma. May cause narcotic effects in high concentration. Causes upper respiratory tract irritation. Inhalation of vapors may cause drowsiness and dizziness.
  
  Chronic: Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause defatting and dermatitis.


Safety data sheets sound terrible! But in reality, people use rubbing alcohol with common sense, without putting into their eyes, without drinking it, etc.

54854,Why don't we build up an immunity to sore throat?,"We often get sore throats once or twice a year, and it clears in a few days sometimes without any antibiotics. I was wondering why doesn't our body become immune after clearing a sore throat?
",57513," Short Answer 


It should be noted that there are many non-pathogenic causes of sore throat, and I would suspect that you are not always distinguishing these causes from actual illness.


In most cases, it would not be possible to build a response (immunological or otherwise) to avoid reacting to these stressors. 

Bacteria and viruses mutate frequently in ways that make your immune system unable to properly recognize them to ward off initial infection.


Your immune system recognizes specific pathogens based on structural characteristics. If those characteristics change when pathogens mutate (which happens fairly frequently), your immune system will not recognize it as readily (or initially at all).  



 Long Answer 

Sore throat is most commonly attributed to pharyngitis, or the inflammation of the back of the throat called the pharynx.

Causes

Sore throats can be caused by many things. (e.g., see here, summarized below):

First off, a sore throat can be the result of many things unrelated to illness: 


Allergies
Dryness
Irritants
Excessive talking,singing,shouting,etc.
Muscle Strain
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)


As a result, at least 30+% (higher in adults) of reported sore throat cases (and supposedly many more unreported cases) are not due to any type of illness. 

Further, a number of pathogens can cause a sore throat:


Viruses


Rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, Epstein–Barr, etc.
(see here for one estimate of relative etiologies). 

Bacteria


A number of bacterial infections can cause a sore throat. The most common is Streptococcus pyogenes (aka ""Strep A""). 



It turns out that pathogen-caused pharyngitis is fairly common. Supposedly 10% of adults with sore throats have strep, and around 70% of children pharyngitis cases seen by doctors are either virally or bacterially caused.  


However, it should be noted that only 20-30% of children and just 5-10% of adults have bacteria to blame for their sore throat, with viral infections being much more common. (source: IDSA).


Sore Throat Frequency

It turns out that sore throats are fairly common; Jones (2004) determined that about 7.5% of people have a sore throat in any three-month period. Further, on average, adults get a sore throat two to three times a year and children about five times a year (Tamparo 2011 and Rutter &amp; Newby 2015), so your personal experience is fairly average.

Because viral causes and non-pathogenic causes make up an overwhelming percentage of overall sore throat cases, it shouldn't be surprising that most sore throats clear up without the use of any antibiotics. 

As for those that are caused by pathogens:

Why no Immunity?

Bacteria and viruses both mutate fairly quickly (see Antigenic Variation, Antigenic Drift and Antigenic Shift), so it shouldn't be surprising that you're capable of having an immune response to pathogens throughout life. 


If we consider just strep alone, it mutates/reemerges with improved fitness frequently (e.g., see Bao et al 2016 and their citations)
And see Sanjuán et al. (2010) for a reviewof viral mutation rates. 


So not only are there a number of pathogens that can cause sore throat, but each of these pathogens can mutate. That leaves you with a fairly sizable number of potential invaders that can illicit a sore throat. 

Let's See How Your Immune System Responds:

Your immune system contains cells that can be split into two broad groups: cells that belong to the adaptive immune system, and cells which belong to the innate immune system. [See here for a simple explanation].


Innate Immune system: consists of cells responsible for initial detection of pathogens, recruitment of other immune cells, activation of the complement system, engulfment and (more immediate) destruction of pathogens. 
Adaptive immune system: consists of cells which coordinate to develop a memory of the infections they've seen previously in order to mount a faster, more pronounced immune response to repeat pathogens.


Depending on the kind of foreign invasion, two different immune responses can occur in either of these 2 broader ""systems"": either a humoral response involving antibodies or a cell-mediated repsponse.



A general feature of the immune system is that these mechanisms rely on detecting structural features of the pathogen or toxin that mark it as distinct from host cells (see Chaplin 2010 for a review). The mechanisms permitting recognition of pathogenic/toxic foreign structures can be broken down into two general categories: 


hard-wired responses encoded by genes that recognize molecular patterns shared both by many microbes and toxins that are not present in the mammalian host. This is the innate system described above.
responses that are encoded by gene elements that somatically rearrange to assemble antigen-binding molecules with extreme specificity for individual unique foreign structures. This is the adaptive system described above.


Antibodies recognizes a unique/specific molecule of the harmful agent, called an antigen, and binds to it to tag it for immune attack.  





  Because the adaptive system is composed of small numbers of cells with specificity for any individual pathogen the responding cells must proliferate after encountering the antigen in order to attain sufficient numbers to mount an effective response against the microbe or the toxin. [Source: Chaplin 2010].



This means that you can still experience some mild symptoms due to the invading pathogen. 



The important take-away from all this, though, is that your immune response relies on structural ""markers"" on pathogens in order to recognize them. This is true for both innate and adaptive immune responses. If the physical/structural properties of a pathogen change (due to antigenic processes and mutations as mentioned above) your immune system will be slower (and possibly ineffective) in responding to an attack.  


The result, then, could be another one of those sore throats...

",Accepted,"As already stated in the comments the animal you found is a tick (Wikipedia).

Since they are known to carry diseases you should make sure you have not been bitten or even still have one sucking your blood. So search your body. If you happen to find one still attached, do NOT squeeze it as this may stimulate fluids to flow from the tick into your body (bad). Instead get it out asap using tweezers or even better specialized tools. If you can't do it yourself ask another person preferably a doctor.

If you have been bitten watch for symtoms of an infection such as a red circle. If in doubt always see a doctor since you might require antibiotic treatment.

NOTE: usually nothing happens so don't worry too much but be alert for changes in skin around bites (if bitten that is).

EDIT: since hotel beds are not a typycal habitat of ticks you probably carried it there yourself.

89977,What's the purpose of segregating a virus from the blood and growing it in the lab?,"I heard that the scientist in Australia found a way to segregate the 2019 NovCoronovirus from the blood. Does this mean they are one step closer to the cure? Why is virus segregation crucial in finding a cure for a viral infection? 
",89981,"2019-NCoV was first cultured by a Chinese group, as published here on January 24. China has not shared samples, but did share sequencing data in the linked paper and via GISAID. The Australian group at the Doherty Institute hasn't published yet, but did put out a press release today (January 29), and appears to be the first group outside of China to have cultured 2019-NCoV. 

Viral isolation, and in particular, culture, is an important, and often difficult step in characterizing a novel virus. Once characterized, viral culture serves as a gold standard for diagnosis. Generally speaking, the ability to grow virus in cell culture allows for a broad range of pre-clinical studies that can lead to clinical advances including prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Consider how difficult it may be to study a pathogen if you are not able to manipulate it in a living culture. You can read about this in Murray Medical Microbiology, Ch 50. This article, which does not require a subscription, may also be of interest. The article describes a variety of historical and modern methods, but also includes some discussion about the use of viral culture.
",Reasonable,"The lac operon contains genes which are important for the metabolization of lactose as an energy source - normally glucose is used for this purpose. Usually the operon is tighly regulated and as long as there is another source of energy it is kept in an inhibited state.

The presence of lactose removes the lac repressor from the lac operon and allows the expression of the genes and thus allowing the metabolization of lactose. The mechanism can be turned on and off depending on the presence of lactose.

IPTG is a substance which mimicks the presence of allolactose (a metabolite of lactose) and it can activate transcription from the lac operon. As IPTG (in contrast to allolactose) cannot be hydrolyzed by β-galactosidase, it's concentration in the cell stays the same. Using the lac operon and IPTG enables you to switch on the expression of the gene on your plasmid and to start the overexpression.

The worms recovered from deep mining boreholes are not particularly specifically adapted to live that far down: they have similar oxygen/temperature requirements as surface nematodes. 

The Tau Tona mine is about 3.5 kilometers deep and about 60˚ C at the bottom. Hydrothermal vent life does just fine up to about 80˚C, and the crust gets warmer at ""about"" 25˚C per kilometer. It's entirely reasonable to expect life to about 5 kilometers down, but further than that is speculation.

Increasing pressure helps to stabilize biological molecules that would otherwise disintegrate at those temperatures, so it's not impossible there could be life even deeper. It may even be likely, given that the Tau Tona life breathes oxygen.

I am certain no life we might recognize as life exists in the upper mantle.

I did some reading and traced links back to the DHS's ready.gov website, and it recommended preparing a 2-week supply of food, water, medicine, and hygiene products for ISOLATION, though I expect if you're sick you're supposed to plan a trip to the hospital. Most of that makes sense to me. The exception is the supply of water. We have public water systems that send drinkable water to us, so why do we need to prepare a stash?

I tried finding an answer online, but I couldn't. The only guess I have is that coronavirus can contaminate the public water system, and it's not guaranteed water treatment will work. Who here has the know-how on waterborne viruses and water treatment to address this speculation?

Viruses can also spread via swimming pools, i.e. hepatitus A and norovirus have been associated with swimming pools. (from ""a review of waterborne viral deseases associated with swimming pools"").

Boiling water will kill viruses. Children have very little reaction to the virus when they carry it, so it's likely that they act as a transmitter more than water does. I'm not worried about it at all by the way, just do what the doctors advise. 
",Reasonable,"Sea anemones are members of the phylum of Cnidaria. Distinguishing features of this phylum are radial symmetry and the presence of cnidocytes, or stinging cells (like the ones found in jelly fish). These cells have a mechanical trigger and if activated a subcellular harpoon is fired and paralyzing and painful toxin is injected. A cnidocyte diagram is shown below (from Wikipedia):



The Cnidarian nervous system is relatively simple indeed. The Cnidarian nervous system is decentralized and diffuse, and it basically consists of reflex arches. It is referred to as a ""nerve net"" as shown in the following schematic of a sea-anemone's nervous system (picture from Florida Int. University):

   

The presence of cnidocytes and a mesh nervous system basically answer your question: 

1) Feeding: Whenever a prey touches the sting cells, it gets harpooned and paralyzed. The mechano-sensory cells sense touch, and drive nervous cells in the mesh. The nervous cells activate contractile epithelial cells in the arms of the anemone that push the prey inside the mouth. Then digestion takes place and the mouth serves as anus once digestion is complete.

2) Defense: the cnidocytes operate by mechanical triggering and no nerve cells are necessary.

41864,How to obtain virus samples?,"I'm trying to observe the behavior of simple viruses in different environments. I'm just looking for simple viruses like the common cold and the flu virus nothing major. Is there a way to obtain them? 
",41867,"First of all, cold and flu viruses are not 'simple viruses', and they are not harmless. They kill tens to hundreds of thousands of people every year. 

Secondly, this would depend highly on the risk group that the virus falls in. The NIH sets strict guidelines on who can handle infectious agents. Unfortunately, I can almost guarantee you that no one is going to give you even risk group 1 plant viruses, and they are certainly are not going to give you cold or flu viruses. Risk groups range from 1 to 4. To handle risk group 2 viruses, for example, you are expected to do so in a BSL-2 or higher laboratory, and anyone maintaining stocks of virus is going to do a hefty check of you and your 'facilities' before shipping you anything.

Furthermore, even if you did obtain the virus, you would need to store it or maintain stocks of the virus in tissue culture. Its not like you can just get an eppendorf tube of virus in saline and expect it to survive in your refrigerator at home, and its not like companies are shipping virus willy-nilly to anyone.

That being said, and at the expense of sounding self-righteous, there is really no reason for you to obtain virus particles. You should start by getting a book on virology and reading it. There is plenty of learning material both visual and written out there, and all I will say is if you don't already know how to culture virus or where to obtain it, you shouldnt be doing so, and no one is going to give it to you.

Interestingly, myocardial infarction increases ACE2 expression in the heart in an animal model ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15671045 ).  The paper found no significant effect from ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, but I don't think I can assume ARBs would work the same way.  (I am suspicious they might increase it based on the increase in the product Ang(1-7) level - https://www.nature.com/articles/hr200974 )  Note that soluble sACE2 can bind cells that did not produce it, by an RGD independent association with integrin beta 1.

This includes the common drugs lisinopril and losartan.  (see also https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcmm.12573 ) Unfortunately the paper did not report substances inhibiting ACE2 expression.  But https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00239.2008 reported that high glucose (!) or PKC inhibitors could reduce ACE2 expression.  (but the high glucose was causing kidney injury, which as described above could mean more ACE2...)  The anti-diabetes drug liraglutide increased ACE2: https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/156/10/3559/2422879  To top it all off?  SARS itself decreases ACE2 expression, and this might be part of the process injuring the lungs: https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1267

This is by no means a complete survey, and there is much I don't understand.  The relationship between ACE2 biology and the emerging COVID-19 risk groups seems apparent - as is the urgent need for research to determine which manipulations to ACE2 expression have positive versus negative effects on the prognosis of that disease.

(I am ignoring that last part)

So you suggest intelligence (the modern human brain) evolved solely as a sexual dimorohism which then migigated over time? 

I find that particular combination unlikely because intelligence would somehow need a sex-chromosome dependence which later was somehow lost. I don't think sexual dimorohism in intelligence can by seen in any mammals, and losing it again is unlikely as well. 

But I can't disprove your idea completely: It seems the brain specific expression pattern is quite different in males and females. Also some brain specific genes were found as additional copies on sex chromosomes.

With either of these 2 facts alone there is at least some miniscule potential that your hypothesis could be true!

The first wave was typical for a flu virus, targetting mainly elderly people, but the second wave was far deadlier and killed far more young people. How likely is it for something similar to happen with the current coronavirus? Also, wikipedia states that people who contracted the virus during the first wave were immune to it in the second wave. I thought when a virus mutates it usually avoids detection, hence why we need to usually get an up to date flu vaccine annually. Why was this not the case for the spanish influenza?
",92213,"This is a great biological question! It asks a lot about how empirical science is done in the field of modern biology! I'm glad we encourage such questions from curious people who want to learn more.

Mutations are mostly deleterious to begin with. This means that mutant copies of virus only very rarely survive and proliferate. A virus that is deadlier will already be less likely to reproduce, having killed more hosts.

The current estimated mutation rate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is 24 bases per year. Of those mutations, those to be most concerned about are those which would mutate the proteins specific to this virus. Vaccine development will aim to train the immune system to target those proteins, particularly the S or spike protein.

Mutations to those proteins can make potential vaccines less effective. This is why influenza (""flu"") vaccines, which are produced ahead of the flu season, may not always line up against the more prevalent strains which result.

A recent comment was published in Nature, authored by life scientists and epidemiologists, which goes into your question in more detail, as regards to the novel coronavirus:


  In this case and that of SARS-CoV-2, mutations consume the narrative, even though individual mutations seldom become fixed during outbreaks nor modulate complex virological traits. Rather, mutation is a humdrum aspect of life for an RNA virus. Because these viruses employ an intrinsically error-prone RNA polymerase for replication, their genomes will accumulate mutations during every copying cycle. Moreover, these cycles can occur on the order of hours, ensuring that a diverse virus population will be generated within a single infected host. While this amazing capacity to mutate fuels the engine of evolutionary change, most mutations adversely impact some aspect of virus function and are removed by natural selection. (emphasis added)


Further, and more to the original point of your question:


  These warnings will probably not halt the question as to whether mutations will arise in SARS-CoV-2, enabling it to spread more efficiently between humans or generate a higher case fatality rate. In response, we can look to the 2002–2003 SARS-CoV epidemic. Large deletions in the open reading frame 8 (ORF8) region and mutations in the spike (S) protein were discovered during the early stages of the outbreak and eventually dominated the epidemic, suggesting that these were adaptations to humans12,13. Based on this observation, some hypothesized that virus genetic changes in part drove the SARS epidemic, but this claim is unsubstantiated14. So, could SARS-CoV-2 adapt in the same way? Yes. Will adaptation precipitate more deaths? Unlikely. (emph. added)

90864,How is the protease inhibited by lopinavir different in SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV?,"The protease inhibitor lopinavir, originally developed as a cure against AIDS and HIV, has been shown efficient against SARS Coronavirus SARS-CoV. 


  Dayer M R, Taleb-Gassabi S, Dayer M S. Lopinavir; A Potent Drug against Coronavirus Infection: Insight from Molecular Docking Study, Arch Clin Infect Dis. 2017 ; 12(4):e13823. doi: 10.5812/archcid.13823.


Why is Lopinavir not efficient against SARS-CoV-2? Is there a difference in the gene encoding for the protease?
",90866,"Is there a difference in the gene encoding for the protease?

This paper by Wu et al. annotates the SARS-CoV-2 genome and compares its divergence from other coronaviruses, which may help answer your second question.

This annotation includes 16 genes for non-structural protein (""nsp""). Supplemental materials for this paper indicate that all but two of these proteins (nsp7 and nsp13) have amino acid substitutions between SARS-CoV-2 (""2019-nCoV"" in the paper) and SARS-CoV. 

The gene nsp5 encodes 3CLpro (chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease), so there are differences there. 

Literature suggests nsp5 and other non-structural proteins are potential targets for a number of antiviral therapies.

Another paper suggests further that lopinavir targets nsp3 products, among other proteins, in use against SARS-CoV:


  Lopinavir’s possible target is Nsp3b, Nsp3c, helicase, NRBD or E-channel with the mfScores of –158.050, –189.140, –114.018, –171.127, and –221.785, respectively.


The nsp3 gene contains a papain-like protease 2 (PL2pro) domain. Supplemental materials from the first linked paper suggest nsp3 has a different amino acid sequence between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. 

It might be worth digging into the Wu et al. paper and the raw annotation data to look at what those a.a. substitutions are, to see if that might help in determining why lopinavir is not as efficient at inactivating PL2pro and reducing levels of the novel coronavirus.

It may also be worth considering the target itself. Going back to the Nature Biotechnology article:


  But Erik De Clercq, of the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Leuven, Belgium, says that in searching for or designing effective drugs against COVID-19: “We should stay away from antivirals known to be acting at targets not playing a role in the replication of coronaviruses.” Such drugs include penciclovir, which is targeted at the herpesvirus DNA polymerase, and lopinavir/ritonavir, which are targeted at the HIV protease. Instead, he would favor targeting a virus-specific protein such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, noting that coronaviruses do not contain or use a reverse transcriptase.

",Reasonable,"A review paper on children born by the advent of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and frozen sperm (Lansac &amp; Royere, 2001) concludes that ART children, as compared to the general population:

Do not have increased rates in stillbirths;
Have equivalent sex ratios;
Show no increased occurence of birth defects and no chromosomal abnormalities;
Have normal overall health.
Have normal psychosocial development, at least up to 8-9 years of age, but the available data is scant in this area. 
However, the rate of multiple pregnancies was higher in the ART group. This may be caused by excessive hormonal treatments during artificial insemination therapy, or by ovulation induction treatments and embryo transfer policies (multiple embryos implanted) that may increase the rate of multiple pregnancies.


The authors do conclude that larger and longer studies are needed to support these findings more conclusively, given that their review paper was based on just two studies. It deserves note, however, that both of these studies were prospective in design and included a large population of subjects.

",Reasonable,"Well, ""On the origin of species"" was published in 1859. If we assume that for humans a generation is approximately 20 years, that means that there have been between seven and eight generations since 1859. That is nowehere near enough time to observe evolutionary changes.

So, in answer to your question, not very different at all.

EDIT: 

I think I need to clarify my answer. When we talk about a species evolving or a species being different today than it was X years ago, we are referring to the species as a whole. Of course evolution is an ongoing process, selective pressures are shaping our gene pool constantly. However, in order to say that humans are different today to those of 1859, we would need to show that the prevalence of particular genotypes has changed. That a specific trait (a gene or a mutation in a gene) has become ""fixed"", or, at the very least, that it has spread to a significant percentage of the population.

@niallhaslam's answer gives a link to a wired.com article about genetic resistance to HIV. This is not something that has recently evolved in response to HIV but is the result of an ancestral mutation. The article itself states that:


  Using formulas that estimate how long genetic mutations have been
  around, researchers have discovered that the mutation dates to the
  Middle Ages. 


Granted, this could be a good example of selection in action. If, after many, many more generations, this mutation has spread to the majority, or a significant percentage, of the population, we could point to it as an example of how humans have changed under the selective pressure of HIV infection. In order for this to happen, HIV will have to become common enough that having a resistance to is beneficial to a very large subset of humanity. I would expect to see such selective pressure in, for example, countries like South Africa where 12% of the population is HIV positive. Such pressure, however, will be negligible in countries with lower infection rates. In the US, for example, a recent study found HIV incidence among persons aged 13 years and older to be 42,200–54,000. Since the US has ~312 million people, 54,000 represents ~0.02% of the population. This will not provide enough of a selective pressure to observe differences in the short term evolutionary scale. 

We do not, in fact, ""evolve quickly in response to parasites viruses etc"". Pathogens may apply selective pressure yes. But this is not a quick process. In any case, we do not evolve in response to them. Mutations occur, randomly usually, and if they confer an advantage they may be selected for. Said advantage may be because they confer resistance to disease but even then, the original mutation was not ""in response"" to the pathogen, However, such selection happens over many successive generations and will spread relatively slowly (quickly by evolutionary standards perhaps, but still slow for us, and certainly slower than 7 generations) across the population. The same holds true of epigenetic changes. Even if they can (as now seems likely) be transmitted down the generations, any selective advantage they confer will still act at the generational level.

So, while we are, of course, constantly evolving, there are no significant differences between the humans of today and those of Darwin's times. Sure, some genotypes may exist today that did not then and vice versa. These, however, are not representative of the species' genome. They may become so after many generations but, even if they exist, they have not had time to propagate through the gene pool and cannot be taken as evidence that H. sapiens as a species is ""different"" today.

Besides SARS, another (much) lesser known cross-species jump actually occurred in China in 2016 with SADS-CoV, which killed thousands of pig[let]s, but was not infectious to humans.

Your cells may have mutations but not big chromosomal rearrangements. It is not necessary for tumour cells to have such chromosomal aberrations.

There are methods to determine the structures of these regular components to high precision, like single particle analysis (eg. zika) and X-ray crystallography (bacteriophage HK97). Other parts of the virus are less consistent, either because they are flexible or because they are produced slightly differently each time. The nucleic acid core is often arranged semi-randomly, and the lipid envelope of many viruses can vary greatly, dependent on the process by which parts of the host cell's membrane is pinched off to create new viral particles. Here's an example of pretty extreme variability of influenza particles, based on what cell type they have infected. Virus particles with different shapes can be just as infectious, but if they are too large the number of new viruses produced by an infected cell may be too low.
",Reasonable,"The release of the hormone melatonin is responsible for the feeling of sleepiness. It is released by the pineal gland and production starts when the light fades, as it's production is inhibited by light stimulation of the retina, the onset of the production is called dim-light melatonin onset. Artificial supplementation can increase sleep quality and regularity related to some sleep disorders and is often administered as pills or patches.

Adenosine is an inhibitory neuromodulator, ie it inhibits neural activity. Neural activity can be either excitatory or inhibitory and adenosine more strongly inhibits the excitatory neural activity. Thus, increased adenosine levels should decrease excitatory effect of nervous stimuli and make you feel more relaxed &amp; sleepy.

Other hormones &amp; neural pathways may be involved (serotonin and the serotonergic neural pathways for example) as well as other stimuli like other people's behaviours (yawning, stretching etc.).

This page and the wiki entry on melatonin have much more information.

From sleepfoundation:


  Melatonin is a natural hormone made by your body's pineal gland - a
  pea-sized gland located just above the middle of the brain. During the
  day the pineal is inactive. When the sun goes down and darkness
  occurs, the pineal is ""turned on"" and begins to actively produce
  melatonin, which is released into the blood. Usually, this occurs
  around 9 p.m. As a result, melatonin levels in the blood rise sharply
  and you begin to feel less alert. Sleep becomes more inviting.
  Melatonin levels in the blood stay elevated for about 12 hours - all
  through the night - before the light of a new day when they fall back
  to low daytime levels by about 9 a.m. Daytime levels of melatonin are
  barely detectable.

I am curious mostly about how virus particles are damaged at the molecular level by UV light and how this relates to how vaccines are manufactured today.
",91117,"Short answer: probably not. 

Long answer: for your body to build immunity against something, it needs to identify it as something harmful to you. Otherwise, how would it know if this is just some random particle in your environment that it should ignore? There are molecular clues that your body uses to recognize better whether something is likely a pathogen (that means it should try to build immunity against) and those are some of the additives (known as adjuvants) present in man-made vaccines. 

Also, the route of administration is also important. Things that you eat or breath in are triaged by the waldeyer ring because maybe you just ate something that is alive, but not exactly a pathogen. Dysfunctions in this process (thinking a normal protein is part of a dangerous pathogen) is believed to be one of the possible causes of allergies. Injecting it into your blood-stream often makes it more effective (but there are exceptions: polio vaccine however can be orally administered). 

A nice read about this topic is this: The dichotomy of pathogens and allergens in vaccination approaches.

This is perhaps a must read on this topic: What to expect of a good vaccine and how to achieve it.

I am primarily interested in cases where the disease was the driving factor of extinction of an otherwise well established and healthy population, but examples of species that were in bad shape to begin with are welcome as well.

92318,Where are there analyzable signed directed network datasets?,"I'm looking for biological datasets with specific properties that are available for me to analyze. Informally put, I have a hammer and I am looking for a nail. That is to say, I have an algorithm and I am looking for suitable data to test if it can tell us anything interesting about biology. Let me start by characterizing the properties that I'd like this data to have.

Math Properties

The data must be representable as signed directed graphs, which in less formal terms means that I am looking for a network where the connections between the nodes are arrows with a +/- sign associated with them. 

The signed property of the edges must represent a property of the relation between discrete objects that only takes on one of two values. One way to get signed values from quantitative data would be to use the sign function, keeping only the relations whose sign of the quantitative variable were not equal to zero. Another way is to encode Boolean values, where False is - and True is +. I'd like to further clarify that the data should not only conform to this criteria, but should have instances of both positive and negative paths within the data.

The directed property of the edges mean that we care to distinguish 'A relates to B' from 'B relates to A'; order matters. Both, one, or neither of these relations can hold in these networks between any two nodes A and B. 

Data Properties

The data must be analyzable in the sense that I can obtain the data in a form where I can either (1) immediately analyze the data or (2) transform/manipulate the data into a form that I can analyze. As a computer programmer, I'm likely to be able to find packages for (or code for myself) moderately arbitrary transformations as long as they are computable and interpretable. That is to say, in your answer I would like you to not worry too much about whether you have a ready-to-use software solution for analyzing or transforming the data. What I would like considered is whether there is (1) a direct download for a/the datafile(s) or (2) an application programming interface (API) for downloading the data in either pieces or as a whole. 

Preference will be given to answers that do not cost money, and do not require creating accounts (although either are acceptable). 

All else being equal, I'd prefer larger datasets (n > 1000) over smaller ones. 

Preference will also be given to answers where the dataset has additional variables are available on the vertices. For example, if the vertices represent genes, then additional variables on the vertices would mean more data is available that describe those genes.

Academic Properties

The dataset(s) should be citable.

Examples

While I'm open to other biological subjects, there are two biological topics that I feel should be representable in the mathematical way I've described above.

The first is gene regulation data. The vertices would be genes, and for any two genes A and B we could have any of the following relations


Gene A downregulates Gene B
Gene A upregulates Gene B
Gene B downregulates Gene A
Gene B upregulates Gene A


The second example I've thought of is in biological signaling as the signals are sometimes directional (sender to receiver) and might have some sort of sign (turn on/off, increase/decrease).

Bonus points if the data is topical (COVID-19/coronavirus-related for example).

Data Sources

I've downloaded a few datasets from BioGrid, but I didn't see the kinds of mathematical properties I was looking for in those datasets. If there are datasets here that you think meet my criterion, please mention them.
",92323,"While this does look like a very nice approach, I would actually argue that there are (almost) no biological datasets, that can be directly used for your algorithm - you can only do a sort of meta analysis using results/predictions based on other datasets.

The reason for this is that the nature of a signed graph requires you to look at effects that can have opposite directions, which in biology  pretty much restricts you to regulatory functions*. The problem with that is, that is nearly impossible to directly measure regulatory effects. In all cases I am aware of, one has to measure the magnitude of an effect under different conditions and then calculate regulatory interactions based on that data.

This means any set of regulatory interactions you can put out into your network is already based on a given analysis with inherent assumptions and (potentially) biases.  

This doesn't make the approach impossible, but I do think, it is something you need to be aware of, especially if you want to use multiple datasets.

As for actual datasets that would fit well:


transcription factors have already been mentioned in another answer
other regulatory effects on transcriptions (promoters / enhancers) may also work, though in this case the 'class' of the objects effected (genes/mRNA) is different than the effector
Another type of biological network that might fit are metabolic / enzymatic pathways. For these you could either also look at regulatory interactions (which again may be tricky because both proteins and metabolites can have regulatory effects) or maybe also directly at metabolic flow: in this case nodes in the graph would represent metabolites and edges reactions that produce or consume them. The KEGG database has large numbers of metabolic pathways for many different species.




*I was trying to think of other things, but presence/absence of a signal probably doesn't fit and neither does classification into strong/weak signals (i.e. interactions)

  The common cold is an upper respiratory infection that is caused by
  several families of viruses. Within these virus families, more

  rhinovirus. Rhinoviruses cause up to 40% of colds, and this virus

  important upper respiratory virus families are named coronavirus,
  adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Since so many viruses can
  cause cold symptoms, development of a vaccine for the common cold has

However, there is little cross-neutralization among serotypes, which presents a challenge to vaccine development, given that there are more than 100 different known HRV serotypes (53). Further support for the role of humoral immunity in the prevention and control of HRV infection was observed in a study of patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia. These patients experienced more frequent and severe HRV infections than their healthy spouses despite the administration of replacement immunoglobulin therapy (54).


That's only the beginning. Immunology is very complex.


  To what extent do you think creating a universal vaccine for the common cold could be successful...


Close to, if not, zero.

There are about 120 distinctly different serotypes of rhinovirus which cause the ""common cold"", which could require 120 separate vaccines. Also a significant percentage of ""colds"" are caused by other types of viruses (coronavirus - like tat in China right now, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and parainfluenza viruses) as well as some bacteria.


  Human coronaviruses, members of the Coronaviridae family, were first identified in 1962 and have been particularly difficult to isolate by use of standard cell culture techniques.


One needs to reliably grow a virus before making a vaccine.


  Efforts at vaccine development are hindered by the existence of more than 100 HRV serotypes with high-level sequence variability in the antigenic sites.


And


  Compared to patients with coronavirus-associated colds, there is no difference in respiratory symptom severity or duration.


However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel: the older you get, the fewer new viruses you're exposed to (if you stay in one geograpical location), and the fewer colds you get. I haven't had a ""common cold"" in a few years now. If I move across the continent, I will have more colds.
",Accepted,"Edit: I'm new at this. In response to recommendations I received I've attempted to insert web citations. LMK if I did it wrong...

Yes, your immune system can recognize and protect against viruses you've been infected with in the past. That's why folks typically only get the chickenpox once. But getting a cold does NOT protect you against future colds, largely for the same reasons that a vaccine is highly unlikely (read on...).

There are multiple barriers to creating a successful vaccine against the common cold. First, as you noted, what we call 'the common cold' is really a constellation of symptoms that can be caused by over 200 different organisms 1, most of them viruses (including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus) but also some bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and a couple others named ___ pneumoniae)2. A successful vaccine would need to protect against at least the most common ones (similar to the yearly flu vaccine which typically covers 3 strains of influenza) - a more difficult task than creating a vaccine for, say, polio (which only has 3 strains 3). Second, the reason you have to get the flu shot every year is because the virus mutates. The same goes for cold viruses - they mutate, and rather frequently 1, meaning a new vaccine would need to be developed at least annually.

Additionally colds frankly just aren't a very high priority. While it is true that young babies, the very elderly, and those with certain health conditions can suffer serious complications from a cold, most of us just get an annoying cough &amp; nasal symptoms for a few days. Not a lot of investment is going to be made in preventing such a disease 4 (especially when there's so much money to be made in mitigating treatments).

20970,Does COVID-19 have a case fatality rate of 41%? Is this formula correct?,"According to the data on the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Tracker, as of 3rd February 2020 there were 17491 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, 536 total recoveries and 362 deaths.
From my non-expert calculation this implies a mortality rate of:

(Nd / (Nd + Nr)) * 100 = 41%

where:

Nd is the total number of deaths,
Nr is the total number of full recoveries.

This leaves 16593 people still suffering from the disease who have neither recovered or died.

This is in stark contrast to the publicly disseminated value of ~2% mortality, so have I made a mistake in my calculation or assumptions, or is COVID-19 much more dangerous than commonly claimed?  

[After a helpful discussion in the comments, 'mortality rate' is not the correct term to use here, instead I should say 'Case Fatality Rate'.]
",20980,"The definition of mortality rate that you've given does not match any practical definition I'm familiar with.*

When people talk about the mortality rate of a disease, what they usually mean is the case fatality rate or the death-to-case ratio, which is simply defined as Nd /  Ni, where  Nd is the number of deaths attributed to the disease over a given time period and Ni is the total number of new cases of the disease observed during the same time period.  By this definition, the current case fatality rate of 2019-nCov according to your quoted figures is 362 / 17491 ≈ 2.07%.

(The tracker seems to have been updated since you asked your question, and now lists a total of 20679 confirmed cases and 427 deaths, for a CFR of 427 / 20679 ≈ 2.06%.)

*) As a theoretical definition of the mortality rate in the long run, when all infected patients have either died or recovered, it can sort of make sense.  But then it becomes equivalent to the usual definition of the case fatality rate.



To compare this with your definition of ""mortality rate"" (as Nd /  (Nd + Nr), where Nr is the number of individuals who have recovered from the disease), we need to start by observing that there's no single universal and unambiguous definition of what ""recovering from a disease"" means.  Commonly used definitions tend to be something like ""no symptoms for X days"" and/or ""viral load below N particles per mL for X days"" or simply ""whenever a doctor declares that you're healthy again and lets you out of the hospital"".

Now, let's say that we're using a (somewhat) objective definition of recovery like ""no detectable symptoms for two days"".  The first observation is that any epidemic first observed less than two days ago would, according to your definition, inevitably have a mortality rate of 100% simply because none of the people infected so far would have had time to be considered definitely recovered yet.  (That is assuming that at least one person had died from the infection; otherwise both the numerator and the denominator would be zero, and the rate thus undefined.)

Further, even after some of the earliest cases have been symptom-free long enough to be counted as recovered, your definition would still yield a highly upwards biased estimate of the ""true"" long-term fatality rate during the early phase of the epidemic, when the number of new cases per day is still increasing.  This is because, for most infectious diseases, any deaths typically occur when the disease is at its most severe state, whereas those who survive the disease will then experience a gradual decline in symptoms as their immune system succeeds in halting and reversing the progress of the infection.



For an illustrative example, let's consider a hypothetical disease with a theoretical 1% long-term average CFR — that is to say, exactly 1% of all (recognizably) infected patients will die of the disease.  Let's further assume that this disease typically takes two days to progress from the initial onset of recognizable symptoms to the state of maximum severity, which is when most of the deaths occur.  After this, assuming that the patient survives, the symptoms gradually decline over the following three days.  As remission is possible (but rare), doctors will generally consider a patient recovered only after showing no symptoms for at least two days.  Thus, a typical case would progress as follows:


  onset of symptoms → increasing symptoms (2 days) → peak severity → declining symptoms (3 days) → no symptoms → observation (2 days) → officially recovered (total time: approx. 7 days from onset)


or, for the 1% of patients for whom the disease is fatal:


  onset of symptoms → increasing symptoms (2 days) → death (total time: approx. 2 days from onset)


Now, let's assume that, during the early period of an epidemic when the infection is still spreading exponentially, the number of new cases increases by a factor of 10 every three days.  Thus, during this period, the number of new cases, recoveries and deaths per day might grow approximately as follows (assuming for the sake of the example that exactly 1%, rounded down, of the patients diagnosed on each day will die two days later):

    |     cases     |   recovered   |     deaths    |         |            |  
day |   new | total |   new | total |   new | total | Nd / Ni | Nd/(Nd+Nr) |

As you can see from the table above, naïvely calculating the case fatality rate as (total number of deaths) / (total number of cases) during this exponential growth period does underestimate the true long-term CFR by a factor of (in this case) about 5 due to the two-day lag time between infection and death.  On the other hand, using your formula of (total deaths) / (total deaths + recovered) would overestimate the true CFR by a factor of about 30!

Meanwhile, let's assume that, after the first 12 days, the growth of the epidemic saturates at 10,000 new cases per day.  Now the total numbers will look like this:

    |     cases     |   recovered   |     deaths    |         |            |

As you can see, the two measures of mortality rate do eventually start converging as the growth of the epidemic slows down.  In fact, in the long run, as the majority of patients either recover or die, they do both end up converging to the ""true"" long-term case fatality rate of 1%.  But by then, the epidemic will be basically over.

There are various ways to obtain a more accurate estimate of the long-term fatality rate even during the early exponential growth phase of an epidemic.  One such method would be to look at the outcomes of a single cohort of patients diagnosed at the same time.  For our hypothetical example epidemic, looking e.g. at just the 1000 patients diagnosed on day 10, we could get an accurate estimate of the CFR by day 12 simply by dividing the 10 deaths within that cohort by the total number of patients in the cohort.  Furthermore, observing multiple cohorts would give us a pretty good idea of how long after diagnosis we would need to wait before the estimated case fatality rate for each cohort gets close to its final true value.

Unfortunately carrying out this kind of cohort analysis for 2019-nCov would require more detailed information than the tracker you've linked to provides.  Even the time series spreadsheet the tracker links to doesn't directly provide such detailed cohort data, although it might be possible to obtain better estimates from it by making some more or less reasonable assumptions about the typical progress of the disease.



Addendum: A few preliminary cohort studies of the kind I describe above do appear to have already been published for 2019-nCoV.

In particular, ""A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern"" by Wang et al. and ""Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China"" by Huang et al., both published on January 24 in The Lancet, note that, out of the first 41 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV before Jan 2, 2020 in Wuhan, six had died (and 28 had been discharged, leaving seven hospitalized) by Jan 22, giving a case fatality rate of 14.6% in this cohort.

However, they do advise treating this figure with due caution, noting a number of reasons (besides just the small number of cases examined) why it may not fully reflect the eventual long-term CFR:


  ""However, both of these [CFR] estimates [of 14.6% from the 41 patient cohort and of 2.9% from all 835 cases confirmed at the time of writing] should be treated with great caution because not all patients have concluded their illness (ie, recovered or died) and the true number of infections and full disease spectrum are unknown. Importantly, in emerging viral infection outbreaks the case-fatality ratio is often overestimated in the early stages because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases. As further data on the spectrum of mild or asymptomatic infection becomes available, one case of which was documented by Chan and colleagues, the case-fatality ratio is likely to decrease.""


There's also a later paper titled ""Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study"" by Chen et al., published on Jan 30, that examines a cohort of 99 patients diagnosed between Jan 1 to Jan 20 and reports a CFR of 11% within this cohort.  However, the study only followed these patients up to Jan 25, by which time more than half of them (57 out of 99) still remained hospitalized.

While most of the URI share similar manifestations like rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough and sore throat, some symptoms may be much likely associated with a specific type of virus: myalgia and fatigue are commonly seen in influenza and parainfluenza infections, while conjunctivitis are often linked to adenovirus infection.

In general cases, URI are self limited diseases. However, some patients (children aged less than 1 year and adults aged more than 65 years, pregnant woman, and people of any age with comorbid illnesses) are at risk of developing complications. Pulmonary complications are the most frequent complications of influenza infection and are often associated with secondary bacterial infection that can lead to acute lung injury. The latter is associated with high mortality rate. Neuromuscular and cardiovascular complications are less common.

My theory now is, that the unwashed strawberries carried the pathogen. Here are some thoughts that might support this:


Since I got hit so fast I'm assuming being exposed to a high number of bacteria.
The pathogens where possibly passed by an ill harvester.
Strawberries being sweet, moist and un-chilled seem to be the perfect fertile ground for reproduction.
The incubation period of colds is usually a lot longer (2-5 days). Does a higher number of bacteria result in a shorter incubation period?
Washing the strawberries would have helped. The bacteria was just on the surface area, since the vessels of the strawberries of course where not alive anymore.

They all have been found to have an incubation period ranging from 2 up to 8 days. This includes ""normal"" infection, and I strongly doubt the strawberries will carry a lot more viruses than standard infections (see below). Only 5% of cases will have an incubation period shorter than 20 hours. Because they are distributed normally, it is very unlikely to have an incubation period of 3-6 hours, which is what you described.

Also, think about exponential growth. If the amount of viruses in your body were doubled every 2 hours (I don't have any numbers for that, but anything above seems unlikely), and your incubation time was 30 hours earlier than expected, you would have to have taken in 215 more viruses than the normally infected.

  Besides pyrethroid-based products, ingredients to be wary of are organophosphate insecticides (OPs) and carbamates, both of which are found in various flea and tick products.  The only OP currently found in flea and tick products in the U.S. is tetrachlorvinphos.  This chemical is classified by the EPA as being ""likely to be carcinogenic to humans.""  There are questions about the effects of long-term, cumulative exposures as well as combined exposures from the use of other products containing OPs and carbamates.  Permethrin is another chemical that the EPA has classified as ""likely to be carcinogenic to humans"" if ingested orally. 
  
  If the ingredient list includes carbaryl or propoxur, the product contains a carbamate.  According to the NRDC, the potential dangers posed by thee products are greatest for children and pets.  Propoxur is considered to be a ""probable human carcinogen"" by the EPA.  As of September 2010, Carbaryl will no longer be permitted for use in new pet products.  However, existing stock of flea/tick products containing carbaryl can still be sold.  The HSUS recommends that pet products containing carbaryl should be disposed of and not used on pets.

",Accepted,"We should clarify some terms here. Scoliosis is a deformation, but Lordosis and kyphosis are not. The latter two are normal structural parts of human spine. 

Back to your question, we don´t know.

Altogether the pathogenesis of scoliosis is poorly established and mostly unknown. 

In adolescent scoliosis, it seems that presence of scoliosis is mostly associated to genetic factors (Burwell et al.). 97% of patients presenting with adolescent scoliosis have a positive familial history (Dayer et al.).

A recent review article sums the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of scoliosis (Dayer et al.). The interactions in molecular level, brain, vestibular system and in structural biomechanics are extremely complex and authors conclude quite fairly: ""Many factors are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of adolescent scoliosis, leading some authors to formulate a complex collective model from these different concepts.""

As so there is not currently any explicit evidence which would state the harms of any static risk factors (sleeping) affecting to development of scoliosis. Partly due to this vagueness I think the debate regarding risk of scoliosis is prone to bias and emotional ""truths"" and wisdoms.

In a recent population level study, authors found that sleeping in hammock was inversely associated to scoliosis (Baroni et al.). Still, it's possible that this study failed to take into account the possibility that children with scoliosis might be less likely to sleep in a hammock because of possible back pain in the morning. Correlation (or inverse correlation) does not imply causation.

21198,What protects Chinese provinces other than Hubei from COVID-19 outbreak?,"In China, the largest number of reported COVID-19 infections was in Hubei province.

Other countries are experiencing exponential increase in reported infections, while the remainder of China is reporting relatively small numbers of casessource_1

What protects Chinese provinces other than Hubei from COVID-19 outbreak?


What is different about the remainder of China compared to the rest of the world?
Is there anything we can learn from the provinces in China that so far were less affected by the virus than Hubei?

",21211,"I live in Guangdong, and this is what I've been seeing &amp; reading about.

Wuhan (city in Hubei) is where the outbreak supposedly began. And it went unnoticed for a while, which mean it was spreading locally more-so than it was spreading nationally/internationally. Near at the start of the Chinese New Year holiday, the government decided to quarantine all of Hubei province. So while other provinces already had infected people, they spread hadn't grown as significantly as it had in Hubei yet.

The Chinese government then decided to take specific measures to control the epidemic. For starters, they required mask-wearing and encouraged staying indoors. They also began to set up body temperature checks all over the place (apartments, neighborhoods, roads leading into cities, and places of work once the holiday ended. Fever seems to be the first symptom, so this is why).

If anyone in an apartment building was confirmed to have the virus, then the entire building and all residents were/are quarantined for 14 days (happened to a 30+ story apartment building next to mine). Elevators, doors, and other public spaces are often disinfected, particularly if a suspected case had been in the area. Again, I saw this at a temperature checkpoint, someone must've had a fever and a little bit later some folks came and sprayed down the area.

Schools are also closed in all provinces across the country, and students are doing online schooling. Some companies are also allowing employees to work from home, or 'staggering' their work days (half come in into the office on Mon, Wed, Fri, the other half come in Tuesday and Thursday). This decreases the number of people a possible infected person can pass the virus to.

On top of this, companies needed to 'apply' to be able to resume work. Here in Shenzhen, nobody could return to work within 14 days of returning from the city, assuming they left during the holiday. We also need to record down our body temp when coming to and leaving from work. According to an SMS I received from the local government, if 2 employees have a body temperature >= 37.3C, then it needs to be reported immediately, as it indicates a possible spread in that workplace.

In short, the virus was able to take a foothold in Hubei, and it was noticed before it took a significant foothold in other provinces. Therefore other provinces had time to implement proactive and preventative measures, before the situation grew to Hubei-level of significance.

The best way to prevent it from spreading is simple steps, such as not going outside unless its necessary, avoid close contact with others (defined as within 6 feet for an extended period of time), washing your hands, and disinfecting often-touched surfaces like door knobs, keyboards, cell phones, etc. It remains to be seen whether other countries will take the same rather drastic measures that are being taken in China, I suppose it all depends on how bad things get in other countries.
",Accepted,"This is an excellent question. In my attempt to answer it I'll cite sources from the best research on the subject to date, and we'll conduct our own investigation.

Body size vs. Head size vs. Brain volume

In your question, you asked how body size (weight and height) relates to brain volume by gender. Body size is related to brain volume through another measure, head size. Larger body, larger head, larger brain.a Men and women have different body sizes, and different head sizes as well.  



Conducting our own investigation

Sample

In the paper you referenced, Gur et. al. looked at 80 healthy (40 male and 40 female) volunteers aged 18-45 years. They used an automated parcellation approach, meaning they used automated image processing on the brain images to derive their measurements.

In our investigation, we'll use data frome the publicly available Human Connectome Project, or HCP. We'll look at 896 healthy (393 Male and 503 female) volunteers aged 22-36 years. HCP also used an automated parcellation software, called FreeSurfer.b We'll use IntraCranial Volume - the volume inside the cranium - to represent head size.

Total Brain Volume - Males vs Females






We see here that men have larger brains than women. We can also see from the linear model results that the estimated mean difference from our sample is a substantial 153.9 milliliters (as compared to ~200 milliliters in Gur et. al. 2001). For reference, this is about 2/3 one of those half pint boxes of milk you used to get at school lunch.

But how much is total brain volume related to head size?

TBV vs ICV



We can see right away that these two measures are highly correlated. It makes sense. Typically, bigger animals -- with corresponding bigger heads -- have bigger brains:



But what you want to know is whether the difference remains after accounting for head size. In other words, is the difference disproportionate to head size?

Adjusting TBV by ICV

Here we use a method called residualizing to remove the effect of ICV on TBV we observed above. You can find the code we're using here, and a reference describing the procedure in detail here.

Let's check the graph of TBV vs ICV again, to make sure the effect is removed.



Revisiting TBV in Males vs Females

Here we'll reexamine the difference between Male and Female brain sizes using the adjusted values.



The difference is still statistically significant, but smaller. The linear model estimates the adjusted average difference to be 23.6 milliliters (compared to 153.9 before). Going back to the milk reference, this is about 1/10 the box, or one sip.



Conclusions

We found that the difference in brain volumes between men and women is partially, but not completely explained by their difference in head sizes.

The difference is smaller, but still there after adjusting. Now your next question may be, so what? Do these differences in brain volume explain anything about behavior or ability? That's where papers like the one you referenced come in. 

Gur et. al. suggest in their paper that females compensate for smaller total brain volume by having increased gray matter, and therefore more tissue available for computation. Other studies conclude that in order to understand gender differences in cognitive ability, you have to look closer at the parts of the brain that are activated during different tasks.c

The HCP data could help us test these ideas too, but that's outside the scope of your question.

they don't have Coronavirus -- or even a virus at all. I coughed a lot when my lungs were full of tumours. Some people cough when their asthma is acting up. This is by far the most common case.

they do have Coronavirus, are not wearing a mask, and are less than 2 metres from you. Droplets may already have landed on you. Getting off will not stop that.


While on the bus, do not touch your face. When you get off the bus, sanitize your hands or wash them with soap and water if you can. Now it no longer matters whether droplets landed on you.

Notice that the CDC advice doesn't say ""if you find yourself near someone coughing, get away from them as soon as you can."" Doing so is either unnecessary (first two bullets) or won't help (last bullet - it's too late, but handwashing will save you anyway.)

21226,Is Coronavirus (Covid-19) considered a pandemic?,"It is my understanding that ""epidemic"" is an abnormally high amount of cases than expected. ""Pandemic"" refers to a epidemic that crosses continents (Please correct my understanding if it is wrong).

My question is should coronavirus (that is, covid-19) be considered a ""pandemic"" ar this point, or is there some other criteria it would need to fulfill to be considered a ""pandemic""? Perhaps an organization like WHO would need to designate it as a ""pandemic""?
",21227,"note: as can be expected from a dynamic event, this answer has changed a bit. The WHO now considers COVID-19 a pandemic; when this answer was initially written, they did not: see the update at the end.

According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases as reported by CNN:


  ""It really is borderline semantics, to be honest with you,"" Fauci said.
  
  ""I think you could have people arguing each end of it,"" he said. ""Pandemics mean different things to different people.""


The word pandemic itself refers to:


  an epidemic of disease that has spread across a large region; for instance multiple continents, or worldwide.


Given a broad definition like this one, it seems like yes, you could make a case that this is already a pandemic: COVID-19 is found on all richly inhabited continents and is continuing to spread.

However, there are still many places that have few cases compared to the outbreak centers, and only a tiny percentage of the world population is known to have been infected (the latest WHO report covers nearly 91,000 cases, a large number, but a tiny percentage: only 0.0012% of the world population of over 7.5 billion).

By comparison, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic infected 11–21% of the world population.

Organizations like the WHO have a more stringent operational definition of ""pandemic"", and none that I am aware of at this point have used the ""pandemic"" classification yet in an official pronouncement.

So, if instead of using a broad dictionary interpretation of ""pandemic"", we say: ""considered a pandemic means a reputable global health organization classifies a pandemic"", then the answer is:

No, COVID-19 is not yet considered a pandemic as of March 3rd, 2020.

Ultimately, it doesn't really matter whether the pandemic term is applied or not. It makes most sense to think in terms of actual numbers and the situation ""on the ground"", and to compare those to past outbreaks rather than worrying about the definition or declaration of ""pandemic.""

Update March 11th

As of March 11th, 2020, the WHO now considers COVID-19 to be a pandemic. Consistent with this answer, the WHO stresses that this doesn't really change their guidance:


  ""Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this #coronavirus. It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do""-

",Accepted,"Fasting has some medical applications. Among them is pre-operative fasting which involves wounds. 

But wound healing is basically a status of greatly increased nutritional demands. So, yes, fasting while wounded tends to be a not so good idea:


  Basics in nutrition and wound healing:
  Therefore, local wound management and good documentation of the wound is essential for non-delayed wound healing and prevention of the development of chronic wounds. During the wound-healing process much energy is needed. The energy for the building of new cells is usually released from body energy stores and protein reserves. This can be very challenging for undernourished and malnourished patients.


From that article:
Influence of undernutrition on wound healing
Even in uncomplicated starvation, as during a prolonged fasting, the body of an average adult subject loses 60 to 70 g of protein (240–280 g of muscle tissue) per day. However, severe trauma or sepsis can increase the loss of body protein up to 150 to 250 g (600–1000 g of muscle tissue) per day. Wound healing is delayed in subjects who had periods of starvation (simple or stress starvation) before injury or a surgical procedure due to the lack of endogenous substrates. Further undernutrition impedes wound healing in addition to:


Delayed neovascularization and decreased collagen synthesis   
Prolonged phase of inflammation
Decreased phagocytosis by leukocytes
Dysfunction of B and T cells
Decreased mechanical strength of the skin



  Proteins
  
  Proteins play the most important role throughout the entire wound-healing process. Lymphocytes, leukocytes, phagocytes, monocytes, and macrophagesdimmune system cellsdare mainly comprised of proteins and are necessary to initiate a healthy inflammatory response in the healing process. An adequate supply with proteins is necessary for consistent wound healing. Because collagen is the protein that is produced mainly in the healing wound, a lack of protein decreases the synthesis of collagen and the production of fibroblasts.
  Of course, all proteinogenic amino acids are important during wound healing. There is evidence that some amino acids are especially important for the process. Methionine and cysteine are involved in the synthesis of connective tissue and collagen. Arginine is thought to have a major influence on the proliferation of collagen accretion and on an improved immune reaction.


And of course there is an increased need for fatty acids, vitamin C, iron, zinc etc. From a surgeon's perspective these points need to be considered:


  The metabolic effects of fasting and surgery:
  - fasting rapidly affects metabolism, although gradually adaptation occurs to minimize protein losses
  -  surgery increases metabolic rate and catabolism, of which insulin resistance is related to the magnitude of surgery
  -  insulin treatment in insulin-resistant patients after surgery or trauma markedly improves body metabolism and reduces morbidity and mortality
  -  avoiding preoperative fasting reduces postoperative insulin resistance by about 50% and attenuates postoperative impairment in nitrogen losses, lean body mass and muscle function
  -  fasting or deficient energy intake after surgery does not affect postoperative insulin resistance but does accelerate nitrogen losses
  -  perioperative parenteral nutrition has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with malnutrition, but has no beneficial effects in well fed patients
  -  oral supplements perioperatively may attenuate postoperative weight loss and reduce infectious complications
  -  patients undergoing surgery within a multimodal programme designed to reduce stress and to improve postoperative function display only minor insulin resistance, which allows feeding without hyperglycaemia




For a more comprehensive view of nutrition and wound healing, take a look at


  Nutrition, Anabolism, and the Wound Healing Process: An Overview:
  One is activation of the stress response to injury, and the second is the development of any protein-energy malnutrition (PEM). Any significant wound leads to a hypermetabolic and catabolic state, and nutritional needs are significantly increased. The healing wound depends on adequate nutrient flow. Of particular concern is the presence of any PEM, PEM being defined as a deficiency of energy and protein intake to meet bodily demands. PEM in the presence of a wound leads to the loss of lean body mass (LBM) or protein stores, which will in and of itself impede the healing process. Early aggressive nutrient and micronutritional feeding is essential to control and prevent this process from developing. PEM is commonly seen in the chronic wound population, especially the elderly, disabled, or chronically ill populations where chronic wounds tend to develop.

  If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
  For disinfection, diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and most common EPA-registered
  household disinfectants should be effective.
  
  
  Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application
  and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its
  expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other
  cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against

",Accepted,"First, let's define retrograde amnesia carefully. You'll find many sources listing drugs that cause retrograde amnesia but they're using the term incorrectly.

From http://www.human-memory.net/disorders_retrograde.html:


  Retrograde amnesia is a form of amnesia where someone is unable to
  recall events that occurred before the development of the amnesia,
  even though they may be able to encode and memorize new things that
  occur after the onset.


With that definition in mind, I don't think drugs exist that cause retrograde amnesia for the past few days, much less years. Some drugs will create retrograde amnesia for memories formed minutes before administration, but not much longer than that. This is believed to be because they interfere with the memory formation process, which is still incomplete when the drug is taken.

Long term alcohol abuse can cause retrograde amnesia, but that's due to the brain damage it causes after long-term abuse. No single binge, even a long one, will cause retrograde amnesia if the abuse is short-lived.

There are animal experiments that have produced retrograde amnesia by administering agents directly to the brain, but that's not something a doctor can give you. They may lead to such drugs in the future, but they're not available yet.

There are several drugs that can prevent new memories from being formed such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and anesthesia agents such as propofol, but they all work by preventing new memories from being formed while under influence of the drug. They don't wipe out memories formed before the drug was taken and therefore can't be said to cause retrograde amnesia.

So, basically, true retrograde amnesia is usually due to brain damage from agents such as dementia, trauma, stroke, infection, prolonged seizures, and long-term substance abuse. There are no drugs a doctor can give you that will accomplish this.

",21259,"Containment

The most important factor is containment:


In the epicenter 60 million people were locked down. So if you can't leave your home you can't infect others nor get infected by others.
Across the country 780 million people were under travel restrictions.
Some areas only one family member is allowed to leave the home every 2 days to get supplies.
Community Committees (non existent in most other countries) deliver food and check on condition of those locked down.


Today China is changing into ""targeted containment"" where certain cities with no new cases for five days still have borders closed but allow citizens to now move freely within city borders.

Some other considerations:


China is very nimble in setting up a 1,000 bed hospital in a week (16 were setup I believe).
China was quick to develop a 15 minute test kit for Novel Coronavirus]2. This allows infected people to be quickly separated and allows those not infected to continue without undue fear or restrictions on work, school or family relations. By comparison US refused (for a week) to test people in a deadly infected Washington State Nursing Home where at least 50 staff in inmates, um er residents, are showing symptoms.
CT scans. When labs could no longer keep up to number of test samples, hospitals in China resorted to cat scans of the lungs as reported February 13th. There have been no reports in the media if US hospitals have CT scanning machines that doctors know how to read to classify a patient as ""presumptive positive"". There was mild upheaval when China included CT scan cases in their daily reports.




What ""we"" started doing March 8, 2020 similar to China

You don't say who ""we"" are but I presume it is EU / North America. From that point of view Italy has just implemented a policy a little less strict than China today. The daily link contents will change tomorrow so I'll include March 8, 2020 (GMT) link contents here:


  ITALY EMERGENCY MEASURES
  
  16 days after the beginning of the outbreak, the Italian government
  took decree today to take exceptional measures to contain about 16
  million Italians living in 14 provinces in the north of the country,
  as well as restrictive measures covering the whole country. [source]
  
  Northern Italy under lockdown
  
  (... SNIP original March 8, 2020 post shortened on March 12, 2020...)
  
  
  Sports competitions are suspended with some exceptions
  


Had the national restrictions been implimented a fortnight ago the lockdown may have been less severe today (March 8, 2020). 

Also note like China, Italy has been using the 15 minute test kit presumably backed up by the two to five day lab testing which they say is more accurate.



March 9, 2020 update

Today Italy expanded the ""lockdown"" to the entire nation of 60 million people. Still it isn't as targeted a restriction as China implemented against Wuhan and the province it was in (circles of protection like Linux Kernel and User Space tools).

Today Israel announced all people coming into the country must undergo 14 day quarantine. This would include all Americans who historically have been the biggest supporters and creators of Israel.

Note Israel's actions go above and beyond the steps China has taken. It more akin to the steps some regions took during the Spanish Flu of 1918. Sorry direct link not available I recall researching this a few days / week ago.

Although Israel is using a stronger tactic than which China took two things have to be considered:


People weren't swarming to get to China in February 2020 with USA
declaring it Persona Non-Grata in nation terms.  
Benjamin Netenyahu is facing American Style impeachment and might be using people and this growing pandemic as a ""human shield"" of sorts from his personal problems.


I think the 15 minute field test kit which takes blood sample was what made China successful but only they can answer that and the MSM I have access to isn't asking those questions to seek answers. Currently schools are closing down in USA and other western countries because someone came back from an infected country without giving them a 15 minute field blood test first.



March 10, 2020 Update

Correction to yesterday

I read in Haeratz (sp?) Newspaper online today that Netenyahu exempted Israeli's returning from America from the 14 day quarantine. I don't believe any science backs up the fact returning from a special mission to America exempts one from the Coronavirus.

Lab tests can fail too

Alarmingly in Japan someone infected on the Princess Cruise ship and then cleared for release was still infected because 15 minute blood test wasn't done, just the swab lab test. Note the link is only valid for 24 hours then you have to scroll to March 10:



China developed the 15 minute field test kit on January 31, 2020 and an American company claims to have developed the same 15 minute field test kit. Both are banned by the American CDC though because it measures those who have antibodies fighting the CoronaVirus (stage 1) and antibodies that have defeated the Coronavirus (stage 2). It does not test for the Coronavirus itself.

If you know who has defeated the Coronavirus and have antibodies they are the safest people to have assisting the at risk segment of the population. China nor any other country has said they are doing this though.

Screening everyone crossing the land/air/sea border with a 15 minute test would go a long way to slowing down the virus spread. I hope the reason for not using the 15 minute test isn't because there isn't enough profit in it for labs. Remember to date ""our"" labs have mostly test people who don't have the virus. With the 15 minute test kit they would be testing people who 90% odds do have the virus.

New Rochelle New York State takes a page from China's play book

Tomorrow the Army is moving into New York according to Aljazeera TV to seal off the city and not let anyone leave. Plus they will distribute food to those in quarantine which mimics what China's community committees were doing as posted earlier.

This disease for America and EU is unique in that the ""jet-setters"" / wealthy like the rich Northern region of Italy (initial ground zero) are the global spreaders of the disease (besides local transmission which takes of a week or two later).

The downfall of this lockdown in New York state is it is announced two days before it takes effect giving infected people time to flee and infect others. Had those fleeing been tested it would have mitigated / reduced the chances of virus spread.

To Mask or not to Mask that is the question.

Canada's Prime Minister

The wife of the Prime Minister of Canada is suspected of being infected from in the United Kingdom on a speaking engagement (a high risk adventure IMO):


  In a press release on Thursday, the Prime Minister’s Office said she
  has received a test for the new coronavirus after her symptoms emerged
  last night following her return from a trip to the U.K., where she had
  been doing speaking engagements.
  
  While the prime minister has no symptoms, he is self-isolating until
  her test results are back.
  
  “The doctor’s advice to the prime minister is to continue daily
  activities while self-monitoring, given he is exhibiting no symptoms
  himself. However, out of an abundance of caution, the prime minister
  is opting to self-isolate and work from home until receiving Sophie’s
  results,” the release said.


The Prime Minister's Doctor gave the wrong advise. At my workplace yesterday they announced a coworker was being tested (4 days for results) and is self isolate because his wife works with a Doctor who had tested positive. So we have two health ""professionals"" the one in Ottawa Canada playing fast &amp; loose, the one in Edmonton Canada erring on the side of caution.

Everyone at work is worrying now. I wish we had the 15 minute field test kit so we can quickly separate the ""suspected wheat"" from the ""suspected chaff"". The good news is unlike the USA we can do tests on possible cases here in Edmonton Canada. Tom Hanks is also thankful today he could be tested in positive Australia and wasn't in the USA would they would refuse to test him.

China is a surveillance state which can control social media and MSM for sure. Canada and USA could utilize the anti-terrorism network built a decade ago including no-fly lists and turn it into a ""anti-coronavirus"" network. Another example of what ""we"" could be doing more like China using existing computer databases and surveillance tracking resources.

What Alberta announced today

EDMONTON -- As part of a new aggressive measure to fight the coronavirus pandemic, Alberta is cancelling all large gatherings and advising against international travel. Furthermore the link states:


  The province is advising Albertans against travelling
  internationally.
  
  ""Given the rapid spread of this virus, it is no longer possible to
  assess health risks for the duration of the trip,"" Hinshaw said.
  
  She is also recommending all Albertans currently outside of Canada to
  self-isolate for 14 days after their trip.
  
  Hinshaw said the risk of contracting coronavirus in Alberta has not
  changed in the past 24 hours, but is concerned that international
  travellers will continue to bring the disease into the province.


With only 23 confirmed cases Alberta is taking early steps to contain the virus without overreacting. The next steps (if cases increase) would be to close beauty parlours, bars and restaurants but I'm biased as I never frequent such establishments. Also I would stop sending fire fighters to non-essential traffic accidents and paramedic responses to save them for well, fighting fires. Random thought would be for Alberta to have disposable surgical gloves at self-serve gas stations for patrons to don before grasping the nozzle to fill up the tank.

Another possible step would be to begin skype (TVOIP) talks with Canadian Military which has a base close to Edmonton with feasibility of ""drafting"" Canadian troops living there. The purpose is for embedding troops with Edmonton Peace Officers and Edmonton Police in a combined ""counter-coronavirus-force"" under a central command and control.

Why troops? It was what my first bus driver after work (I take four buses home after work and am concerned they will shut down in two to three weeks and I'll have to buy a bicycle) said today: ""I hope the banks don't run out of money. This led to a long explanation about fractional reserve banking, gold standard, four Federal Reserve Central banks going bankrupt, currency generated digitally and how not enough real money exists. Anyway more fire power is preferable to not enough when you need it. Besides even if heavy weaponry isn't needed you can always call it a drill and lets face it NATO military doesn't see much ""action"" anyway and will enjoy the ""call to arms"" if nothing else.

Staying on topic, there are no reports I've read that China took these steps and used the military but I ""imagine"" they would have.



March 14, 2020 Update

Getting downvotes so might have to end these ""Save the World who doesn't care Q&amp;A"" updates.

Today Italy announced:


  Italy's health system is overwhelmed:
  
  
  ""We're close to the point of no return for intensive care beds in Lombardy. We have 15 to 20 intensive care beds left. With 85 new
  people entering ICU every day and 2 or 3 leaving, we're close to the
  point of no return. ""There are no more ambulances"" - Lombardy Welfare
  Councilor Gallera added - ""and therefore someone will have to wait
  late in the evening."" [source] 732 patients are currently treated in
  intensive care in Lombardy, and 76 new deaths were reported in the
  region today.
  In Bergamo, ""deaths have quintupled from a week ago. There is a burial every half hour"" said Councilor for Cemetery Services Giacomo
  Angeloni. ""There are many elderly people at home with breathing
  difficulties. They are not hospitalized because the hospitals are
  full"" said the mayor of Alzano Lombardo Carmelo Bertocchi.
  


What would China do?

Hard to say their society is different. What should Italy do? Easier to say if they are like Canada.

Temporarily suspend medical laws. Commandeer white crew cab pickup trucks from dealers at cost plus twenty. Paint red crosses on left and right. Staff with four able-bodied young men. Put a mattress in the box.

Take that 80 person call center designed to rip off seniors with calls to support the Fireman's Burn Unit and Police feed the children fund. Have them call people over 65 twice a day. If they don't answer send aforementioned four men in a pick up truck.

A week ago China would have build 1,000 bed hospitals that take a week to complete. NATO countries should do the same a week before where Italy is today. Scrap white collar surveyors, architects and engineers. Send in the blue collar labourers, concrete finishers, electricians, plumbers, skid steer operators, truck drivers, crane operators, foremen and carpenters with blue prints that China used.

Spain's lockdown today should have exempted warehousing and transportation of food and drugs workers. They will think of that tomorrow.

President Trump's test announced today seems like ""fake news"" if the test only works when upper respiratory tract is infected when a nasal swab is taken. However the kind of test taken was not announced.

China web guru is donated 500,000 test kits to USA today. No word if 100 labs and 1,000 lab workers are included to analyze test results...

I visited the world's second largest mall today. I noticed the indoor hockey rink was closed (like the NHL (I could fix that in a week I think)) and replaced with a bead trinket / fake rock sales flea market. One vendor had a dry cough and another was wearing surgical gloves.

There was a sign outside the bathroom hallway from Alberta Health advising people how to wash hands. At Galaxy land I saw a few amusement ride employees cleaning surfaces. So if they close all the schools here they end up in Galaxy land?

Schools should stay open because teachers know their students better than a random ride attendant. However reinstate the old days where students queue when the first bell rings. Then forehead point and shoot temperature checks will be done.

Allergy season is arriving and probably 10% of the population is effected with running nose and sneezing. They should get a card or something to alleviate the fears of others on the bus or airplane.

People under 30 getting and recovering from BSC should be verified and coveted. Being over 50 I'm not really scared but I'm worried I'll infect that elderly man hobbling down the street today at -20C with his cane. My bus may be no safer for him than ETS DATs. Which reminds me shouldn't they be cleaning the buses here?

Callous individuals surround us and say ""they are old"" lets kill them all with the virus. Forward thinkers will realize they will be old too someday. What would China do? I think they would ""respect their elders"".

Gee Jing Ping (Xi Jingping) wore a mask and sat meters away from other officials when he announced Wuhan (Think Washington DC) and Wubie Province (Think Washington State) had overcome the virus (we don't know that is true yet).

On the other hand Trump and officials wore no PPE and all touched the Mic in some sort of ""speaking is more important than reality"" press conference yesterday (Friday the 13th).

If someone on the bus wears a mask don't freak out. They may be trying to protect you or chances are they are just scared. Don't pick on them.

I have no idea if all of this transpired in China but their culture is different than NATO's and we must adapt because the end results are what count. Life, Liberty and Freedom can be mutually exclusive. For a few months you will have to give up Freedom to save Life. China did do that and appears to have succeeded today. What will history say about YOU?



March 16, 2020 Update

Today Canada announced closing borders to all foreign nationals except US citizens. What would China do?


About two weeks ago the border to Washington state would have been sealed off.
Because people there flow into B.C. the Alberta / BC border would have been sealed off.


What to do today to mimic China?


100 million people live beside the US / Canada border. They like to make day trips to mimic currency arbitrage and buy goods cheaper in other country. This traffic should be shut down.
Canadian health care is free, Americans in past have utilized that system, that should be shut down.
Everyone crossing border by land should be subject to 5 second forehead temperature check with $60 gun. Those with fever must seek medical attention.
Some border crossing like Edmundston New Brunswick and Madawaska, ME, United States are like their own little country. They can manage their own laws and have to worry about keeping outsiders out of both towns.


China succeeded at first locking down Wuhan City and then Hubie province. Italy tried that and failed. Canada / US appears headed for even bigger failure thinking it will save the economy. Perhaps it will in the short term but more long term planning is still needed:


Airlines will ask for bailouts. Tell them to go bankrupt and create new startups in a couple of years.
Edmonton schools are closing for six months. Send teachers out to work for four months even if it is sanitizing buses. After all you are making parents leave work to child care and still expect them to pay 12 months of school taxes right?
It's proposed to pay people unemployment. $800 every two weeks might be fine for 80% of the population but an airline pilot can't live on that if his mortgage and car payments are more than that per month. Don't give the money to company CEOs that lay off all the workers in order to support stock price.
Accept the fact Great Depression can be approaching and learn from those mistakes. People to plan to fail, they fail to plan - like with USA test kits.
Communism at $20/hour is better than capitalism with chance for $200/hr. when reality is $0/hr. No word if China will revert back to communism but their journey is shorter than Canada's would be and especially America's.
My bus driver was in a state of shock an hour ago as she was told tomorrow buses would be running on Saturday schedule which means that bus would not be running. The city bus website had no information on this. Don't make such knee-jerk reactions wait a week even if buses are 25% of capacity before making such announcements.
City of Edmonton website said one employee returning from vacation tested positive but it wasn't related to Recreational Facility or other services closing today. Makes me think it is swimming pool and wonders why they refuse to say?
Border closing by Canada and saying 14 self-isolation for all arriving (EXCEPT US CITIZENS who are immune to SARS 2.0 apparently) me they are math challenged. worldometers.com states some claim incubation period of 2 to 14 days with 5.2 days mean time which is what they are getting 14 from. Others say 0 to 28 days but that isn't the point. They should have said if you are arrived from Italy, Egypt, France, Germany, Washington State, Cruise Ship or blah blah 13 days ago then self isolate for 1 day, if 12 days ago then self isolate for 2 days, etc etc up to today arrivals isolate for 14 days.
No mention if doctors will be trained how to read CT scan of lungs.
No mention if blood test to measure SARS 2.0 anti-bodies will be done. Criminal negligence almost not learning what China learned and shared with the world.
Also consider giving bus drivers temperature guns so I can get my temperature checked twice a day too and self-isolate if necessary. Then call dispatch for mini-bus making circles picking feverish people up to pick them up. Travel by planes offer and border crossings offer great chances to take 5 second temperature check but you need to think out of the box sometimes. Research a few weeks ago revealed only 100 ICU beds in Edmonton and Ventilators can't be ordered over night but temperature guns can be ordered over night...
They warned us weeks ago to get 14 day supply and I did. Today Doug Ford of Ontario told people to stop buying and ""hoarding"". Make up your mind...


Final thoughts for what China would do?

They would lift sanctions against the people of Syria and Iran who suffered enough already in USA bid to cause social unrest due to mass human suffering.

Indeed sanctions against Iran and Syria in the first place, China would have voted down if such a measure was introduced in the United Nations Security Council. We can only imagine how decapitated the hospitals in Northern parts of Syria are now with White Helmets running amok to make Oscar award winning videos backed by the guns of ISIS. Witnessing the lies of test kits and extrapolating to other lies like White Helmets things begin to make sense. Would you like a cup of Karma with your reality check?

Crisis can be an opportunity for change and we can watch how China handles it and hopefully treat them as a three month indication to the future of Covidi-9.

RT reported that China sent medical experts and supplies to Italy after the EU denied support.

Edmonton closed schools today but high school kids were still traveling in buses and associating in groups. It does little good to close schools and still allow kids to associate. China locked down homes and anyone traveling had to produce national ID cards. There are no national ID cards in Canada, my only cards are a debit card and library card (closed in Edmonton as of today). I also carry a bus pass which might have limited value starting tomorrow...

OP's valid question what did China do is almost totally ignored by the Media here whilst USA tries to steal vaccines from other nations to make a fast buck for Trump. Lets make this clear if and when a vaccine is create dit belongs to BSC (Bat Sourced Coronavirus) owner in China who gives it away to the world for free. No patents. No arguments. That said SARS 1.0 vaccine was 13 years in the making before being scrapped in 2016. The world has to stop focusing on maybe's and deal with reality that changes by the hour and is unique to every region and the resources they have in play.

This reminds me of Inventory Control training at work where last week he had to reverse adjustments to stock so this week he has to do the same thing for a different SKU. WRONG. It's on a case by case basis and every case is different. Open your universities 24/7 to develop a vaccine and analyze all those drive through test samples sure. Closing them is about the worst thing you could have done with available resources...

Where are the flight manifests of everyone who arrived from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands over the last 30 days? Were they given to the city of Edmonton Police? Real judges have subpoena powers. It's great you closed BS family court with he-said she-said soap opera now lets get the real judges and real law enforcement working. Politicians with silver spoons including Trudeau &amp; Trump have no idea of how the real world works.

China and Korea (both Republic and Democratic sides) seem to have their act together. As does New Zealand one of the ""five Eyes"" which seems to have had their eye open. Putin and Netenyahu seem more concerned with political extensions. Trump saw a picture of him photo-shopped image playing the violin and tweeted he likes it whilst completely oblivious to the reference ""Nero fiddled while Rome burned"". The media is devoting too much attention to politicians and not doing investigative journalism. Four words; Fifteen Minute Blood Test. Since you have ten fingers three more; Border Temperature Checks.

What would China do?

I imagine by now they would have tracked down all the people that have been to ""Life Care"" (Oxymoron) nursing home in Washington USA and Lynn Valley nursing home in North Vancouver, Canada (been there seen that). No word on if USA and Canada have done that yet???

Also no word from investigative journalists interviewing ""health care professionals"" on if they travel between nursing homes because they are ""specialists""?

Finally on Saturday March 14, 2020 Apple closed all it's stores outside of China and reopened them inside China. I visited West Edmonton Mall and sure enough the store was closed with 4 blue t-shirt clad employees outside closed doors and I said ""So it's true"" (what Tim Cook said). Investigative journalists be asking themselves what Tech companies knew before their governments did. Look how Facebook and Google closed down events a week or fortnight before your governments did. Ask yourself the 5W's and sometimes how?

Happy St. Patrick's Day. Plans to go out tonight got cancelled because Alberta declared a state of emergency.

Guy at work was sent home for coughing because ""it's not safe"". Unemployment will cover a percentage of his wage if he gets tested positive for Covid-19 but you can't see a doctor if you are coughing. Viscous circle / Catch 22.

USA announce 1 trillion in ""juice"" for the economy. I used my ""Big Number Calculator"" and it tells me ""1T / 300M"" = 3K. That will tie an average person over for a month.

Some or many people will be traumatized after a few months of Cabin Fever and never fly again, take a cruise again or trust a stranger again. A crime wave unknown in recent memory could sweep across NATO countries of diversity.

",Accepted,"China temperature checks are everywhere

Just like reported in America recently a fever is part of the New Coronavirus. Indeed the White House has mandatory temperature checks to protect the president as of March 14, 2020.

In Japan a cook infected dozens of patients and staff in an institution we discovered today. No word if Japan mandates cooks to get temperature checks???

I asked my warehouse manager for daily temperature checks for 20 or so fellow co-workers and dozen or so truck drivers that walk in the door and I was scoffed at. Then again the same manager said last week the virus wasn't airborne shrugs.

That said I think it prudent that all cooks in Canada along with take out servers and Uber Eats drivers be tested by a restaurant staff member. Additionally all Safeway employees should be tested at start and end of shift. At Save-On foods and Staples where people are standing in line outside the stores then a common courtesy would be to temperature check them too. With the hand held laser it only seems to take a second. Besides it's not like they are going anywhere fast anyway...

Also I saw two policemen and two fatigue dressed special unit men around two suspects at a bus stop yesterday. I think law enforcement should be armed with temperature lasers too like in China where everyone and their dog (they can catch it as well) are temperature checked by authorities.

March 29, 2020 update

Virus Lockdown in Beijing is an Aljazeera 30 minute documentary in their 101 East group.

Although Beijing was not the epicenter it was locked down. In this episode a western journalist locked down in Beijing records all the temperature checks he had to go through to go shopping. Including simply leaving his apartment building, on the subway and in the shopping center. There is a GPS map that shows you every building where a COVID-19 case was discovered. When it was discovered is differentiated by color in the phone app.

In my city there are thousands upon thousands of government employees being paid to stay home. I suggest they can be repurposed to go out and man temperature checkpoints.

",Accepted,"There are several components to this question:


Is hydrogen peroxide (as used in dental hygiene procedures) absorbed into the body in significant quantities?
Could absorbed hydrogen peroxide have systemic effects?
To what extent is oxidative stress a factor in the pathogenesis of vitiligo?
Can absorbed hydrogen peroxide contribute to the pathogenesis of vitiligo due to an increase in oxidative stress?


I will provide some evidence and discussion for each of these points below.



Background on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)

Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide (a compound with an oxygen–oxygen single bond). It is used as an oxidizer, bleaching agent, and antiseptic. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide is a reactive oxygen species and has been used as a propellant in rocketry. Its chemistry is dominated by the nature of its unstable peroxide bond.





1: Use of H2O2 in dentistry

This paper is a review of the use of hydrogen peroxide in dentistry. 

The levels of H2O2 in toothpastes and dentifrices are generally much lower than those used for teeth whitening or bleaching.


  Studies in which 3% H2O2 or less were used daily for up to 6 years
  showed occasional transitory irritant effects only in a small number
  of subjects with preexisting ulceration, or when high levels of salt
  solutions were concurrently administered. 
  
  In contrast, bleaching
  agents that employ or generate high levels of H2O2  or organic
  peroxides can produce localized oral toxicity following sustained
  exposure if mishandled.


They note potential health concerns raised by animal studies.


  From a single study using the hamster cheek pouch model, 30% H2O2 was
  referred to as a cocarcinogen in the oral mucosa. This (and later)
  studies have shown that at 3% or less, no cocarcinogenic activity or
  adverse effects were observed in the hamster cheek pouch following
  lengthy exposure to H2O2.


So concentrations below 3% seem unlikely to cause significant harm. Beneficial effects (such as improvement in gingival disease and promoting healing due to an antimicrobial effect) are seen at concentrations above 1%.

Based on this, a window of 1-3% concentration of H2O2 would appear to be optimal.



A UK government toxicological report confirms that H2O2 only causes local toxicity by irritation and cellular damage, but it does not cause systemic problems and is not considered a carcinogen.



2: Metabolism of H2O2

H2O2 is a byproduct of many biochemical reactions and is toxic to cells. The enzyme catalase is found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen (such as bacteria, plants, and animals). It catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. It is a very important enzyme in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). These are also known as free radicals.

The reaction is shown below.




  The toxicity of H2O2 is due to oxidation of proteins, membrane lipids
  and DNA by the peroxide ions. The class of biological enzymes called
  superoxide dismutase (SOD) is developed in nearly all living cells as
  an important antioxidant agent. They promote the disproportionation of
  superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which is then rapidly
  decomposed by catalase to oxygen and water.


What is oxidation?

Oxidation is one of a pair of opposite chemical reactions involving transfer of electrons; oxidation and reduction. Together they are known as redox reactions.

Oxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state of an atom by another atom, an ion, or a molecule.

Reduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state of an atom by another atom, an ion, or a molecule.

In a redox reaction, one component is oxidised and the other reduced.


  For example, during the combustion of wood, electrons are transferred
  from carbon atoms in the wood to oxygen atoms in the air. The oxygen
  atoms undergo reduction, gaining electrons, while the carbon atoms
  undergo oxidation, losing electrons. Thus oxygen is the oxidizing
  agent and carbon is the reducing agent in this reaction.


Another example of a redox reaction is the oxidation of glucose to release energy in cellular respiration.

Catalase uses the oxidising power of H2O2 to oxidise other potentially harmful substrates that need to be broken down (like phenols, formic acid, formaldehyde, and alcohol), while the H2O2 itself is reduced in the process. This is called the peroxidation reaction.

Catalase is present in all cells (especially the liver and kidneys). Apart from local tissue destruction, small amounts that might be absorbed would be broken down in this manner.



3: Vitiligo

Vitiligo is a condition in which melanocytes in patches of skin cease production of the pigment melanin.

There are several theories about its pathogenesis. It is associated with certain genetic susceptibility markers and also with other autoimmune disorders, suggesting an autoimmune process. The autoantigen is likely to be the tyrosinase enzyme, which is involved in melanin biosynthesis.

Oxidative stress theory

This research paper discusses oxidative stress in the context of vitiligo.


  In vitiligo, melanocytes are particularly vulnerable to oxidative
  stress owing to the pro-oxidant state generated during melanin
  synthesis and to the genetic antioxidant defects.


In particular, with relevance to catalase:


  In both lesional and non-lesional skin of vitiligo patients, increased
  levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed, accompanied
  with reduced levels and activity of catalase.
  
  It is well known that normal melanocytes are vulnerable to excessive
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) for their specialized function of melanin synthesis, which would
  result in a highly pro-oxidant state in the epidermis.
  
  This imbalance between the pro-oxidants and the antioxidant status can
  disrupt the homeostasis of melanocytes, causing accumulation of
  oxidized and damaged proteins or organelles, and consequently lead to
  the destruction of melanocytes.


So there is evidence of increased oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. However, it is a complex picture, with probable environmental triggers and genetic susceptibility factors. An autoimmune process and oxidative stress are not mutually exclusive, as the former could disable the cellular mechanisms for dealing with the latter.



4: Can absorbed hydrogen peroxide contribute to the pathogenesis of vitiligo due to an increase in oxidative stress?

Essentially, assimilating this information, the answer seems to be no.

Applied hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) primarily causes local irritation and tissue damage, depending on the concentration. It is not significantly absorbed and small absorbed amounts would be quickly broken down by catalase.

While increased susceptibility to oxidative stress in melanocytes plays a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo, it is a disruption of the cellular mechanisms for managing oxidative stress, rather than a primary increase of oxidants (like hydrogen peroxide) that is the main factor.

",Accepted,"Surprisingly when I was looking this up, I figured out it was true. Due to recent research, the below was realised.


  When we’re hot, we naturally cool our bodies primarily by sweating, or more specifically by having the sweat evaporate from our skin (that’s important!). Our bodies sense changes in tissue temperature by a network of thermosensors located in the skin and in more central parts of our body, which send input to our brain (specifically, the hypothalamus), which then initiates sweating.
  
  When we take in a hot drink, it appears that the thermosensors located in the stomach become overactive, and send strong signals to our hypothalamus that we are hot. In turn, the hypothalamus reacts by initiating an over-compensatory sweating response. So, when this sweat evaporates from our skin, the heat energy we lose due to evaporation exceeds the heat energy gained by drinking the hot drink. In other words, it is because our body overacted to the hot drink that we end up cooler in the end

",Accepted,"Facial lesions are very common and the differential is broad. I will attempt to narrow down the possibilities based on size, appearance and presence or absence of pain.

Pain is a significant symptom, and clustering of the lesions is important as well.

Benign facial growths (such as warts, seborrheic keratoses, moles, basal cell carcinomas, cherry angiomas, dermatofibromas, etc., are not fluid-filled, nor painful, so need not be discussed. 

Pre-malignant or malignant skin lesions are also solid, not fluid filled or usually painful.

Bacterial skin infections (acne, abscesses, etc.) are inflammatory, and present as painful, tender areas of swelling and commonly redness, but do not present as clear fluid-filled lesions. Pus may be present with a bacterial skin infection, but pus is white or off white, sometimes blood tinged, not clear. The exception is discussed below.

This leaves blister-like lesions of the face. What are possible causes of blisters on the face? Emphasis will be on the face and small blisters or grouped vesicles. There is a difference between a blister (usually larger than .5 cm) and a vesicle (.1-.4 cm). Also, vesicles can occur singly or in clusters in the same lesion. A cluster of vesicles in the same area may appear to be a blister. They are different.

Varicella Zoster Virus

Before vaccinations became available, the most common cause of blisters on the face was chicken pox. Almost 100% of an unvaccinated population contracts this virus (Varicella Zoster Virus or VZV) at some point in life. While chicken pox is still quite common in many parts of the world, the incidence has fallen considerably in countries routinely vaccinating their young.

The lesions of chicken pox are probably familiar to most adults: multiple small (less than .5 cm) scattered red papules (small bumps on the skin), clear vesicles on a red base, or small crusted lesions on a red base (initially just the papules, followed by lesions in each stage) scattered  all over the body. These lesions are very itchy.

Since VZV infects spinal nerves and lies dormant in the body after chicken pox infection, reactivation (called shingles or herpes zoster) is possible. Like chicken pox, the lesions are clear fluid filled small blisters (called vesicles) on a red base. Unlike chicken pox, reactivation most commonly occurs only in one nerve root at a time, on one side of the body, in the skin which that nerve serves, called a dermatome. Also, the lesions tend to be painful (sometimes very much so), and the skin can be exquisitely sensitive.

The trunk of the body is the most common area to be affected, but the face is commonly affected as well.

The clear fluid from a ruptured vesicle contains live viruses, therefore attention should be directed to avoid infecting others.

Contact or Allergic Dermatitis

Contact with certain chemicals can cause blistering of the skin. Industrial strength cleaners, harsh alkaline substances, etc. can cause painful blistering and redness that looks like a second degree burn of the skin. The source of such chemical burns is usually obvious, as the substance irritates the skin on or very closely after contact. The lesions are usually painful and feel like burns. Treatment is similar to that of burns.

A common allergen causing blistering is urushiol, the active organic compound that in  poison ivy that causes a form of contact dermatitis. With sufficient contact, an itchy, red, vesicular rash will appear after several days where contact has occurred, accompanied by itching. The lesions caused by poison ivy often tend to be linear (caused by rubbing along the edge of the leaf) or diffuse (on the hands) if one has been handling poison ivy. If handling the plant, and accidentally touching the face or other body part, urushiol can be transferred to the face as well. The diagnosis is made by the appearance, the distribution of the rash, the characteristic itchiness without pain, and the history of outdoor potential exposure. 

Impetigo

Impetigo is a skin infection most commonly involving young children, but  it is highly infectious, adult close contacts may be affected. There are two types. Nonbullous impetigo starts as as painless or possibly itchy single papule that progresses to a vesicle. The vesicle ruptures, and the lesion secretes clear fluid that forms the typical honey-colored crust. As the fluid is infectious, the lesion grows in diameter, and new lesions appear near to the initial one. It is commonly found near the nose or mouth, but can occur anywhere on the face/exposed areas of the body.

Bullous impetigo forms small to large, soft blisters which break easily. It is not particularly painful although it can resemble a superficial second-degree burn. Bullous impetigo is not common on the face, rather it seems to occur more commonly in moist areas, such as the diaper area (in infants), the underarms, and neck folds.

Herpes Simplex Virus

Once infected with Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), the virus, like VZV, lives in sensory nerve ganglia. There are two types of HSV, Types 1 and 2. HSV-1 is the common cause of cold sores or ""fever blisters"", but in fact can infect and recur on any part of the body. HSV-2 is the most common cause of genital herpes. Both viruses are spread by direct contact, so any skin/mucosal membranes directly exposed to either HSV-1 or HSV-2 can become infected, with recurrences common. HSV-1 infection, though it is with the same virus, can have different names depending on the area infected: Herpes labialis (lips), sacral herpes (on back near buttocks), herpetic whitlow (fingers), Herpes gladiatorum (aka 'mat herpes', initially diagnosed in wrestlers with close skin-to-skin contact), etc. Herpes Simplex Virus infections can occur anywhere on the body.

HSV, since it infects sensory nerves, is characterized by a period of pain or tingling preceding and accompanying the outbreak of clustered small vesicles - often more than one cluster - on a swollen, sometimes red base. The first outbreak is usually the most dramatic, but it may be minor and overlooked. The pain can often seem disproportionate to the size of the lesion(s).

Caution should be taken not to spread infectious fluid from ruptured vesicles to the eyes (especially, as it can lead to blindness), to other parts of the body, or to other individuals.

Fixed Drug Eruption


  The term fixed drug eruption describes the development of one or more annular or oval erythematous [red] patches as a result of systemic exposure to a drug; these reactions normally resolve with hyperpigmentation [skin darkening] and may recur at the same site with re-exposure to the drug. 


Fixed drug eruptions can occur anywhere (including eyes, mouth, tongue, genitals, etc.), and can take many forms. One form may be a blister. This is called a Bullous fixed drug eruption. Symptoms may include itching, burning, and/or pain. There usually isn't pain preceding the eruption.


  Initially, a single lesion or a few lesions develop, but, with re-exposure, additional lesions occur. The vast majority of patients present with 1-30 lesions, ranging in size of 0.5-5 cm, but reports of lesions greater than 10 cm have been published. Lesions may be generalized. The most common reported site is the lips, and these may be seen in up to half of all cases. 


The initial lesion can be a vesicle or small blister. The characteristic recurrence after one particular drug or class of drugs, hyperpigmentation  (more common in dark-skinned individuals), and lack of pain or tingling preceding eruption helps differentiate this from other causes.

  Why are inflammations painful in the case of a tendinitis?
  
  When suffering from tendinitis, does the inflammation itself cause any
  pain, and if so why?


Based on the definition of tendinitis actually meaning inflammation of a tendon, what's typically associated with this condition, and the body's immune system response with it stimulating nerve cells and triggering pain, inflammation can and does cause pain.  


  Definition (1)
  
  Tendinitis is inflammation or irritation of a tendon — any one of the
  thick fibrous cords that attaches muscle to bone. The condition causes
  pain and tenderness just outside a joint. (1)


When swelling occurs and the immune system responds accordingly, this process can also stimulate nerves and trigger the pain effect so based on this, that is WHY inflammation causes pain with tendinitis or any other condition for this matter with the human body.


  WebMD - Inflammation (2)
  
  When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body's white blood cells
  are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body
  from foreign substances. This release of chemicals increases the blood
  flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and
  warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues,
  resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves
  and cause pain. (2)

However, these articles don't usually say how reliable the testing is. I couldn't find any recent information on it via Google, either (there are some results, e.g. this, but they are old).

How accurate are the tests? What are the odds that Sophie Trudeau's results are a false positive, or that Justin Trudeau's negative result is a false negative?
",21379,"Short answer: Sophie Trudeau's positive test may still mean 3 : 1 odds of not having contracted Covid-19, but the odds could also be far more towards having Covid-19.
Justin Trudeau's negative test almost certainly means he was negative when tested. Of course, should Sophie be positive, that may have changed by now.



Update: I found a web page of the FDA listing tests that have this Emergency Use Approval. Each of them has manufacturer instuctions that list their test results towards the end. Some of the submitted test results use ≈100 negative samples in the clinical evaluation. But there is also one that has only 13 positive cases (all of which were correctly found) in their test - but that one got the emergency approval already early in February.
The latest 2 (by Thermo and Roche) used 60/60 and 50/100 cases for their clinical evaluation (all results correct). That gets the lower end of the confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity to 94 - 97 % (with the lower end of the c.i. we'd thus have LR+ >≈ 20 or 17, expected values would be 61 or 51, respectively. For LR- &lt;≈ 1/20 or 1/32 (expected 1/61 or 1/100). 



Long version: Let's do some number juggling and see whether we can extract something useful. The following calculations are based on a somewhat worst-case scenario: the FDA emergency validation guidelines specify outcomes that such a new test in the current emergency situation must meet, and I calculate from the low end of performance that could be expected meet these criteria under somewhat unlucky circumstances.

So we know minimum performance requirements, but I do not know [yet] how good (= how much better than minimum performance) the tests are.

Sensitivity and Specificity

The starting point would be sensitivity and specificity of the respective test.  I haven't found any published data on these, but the FDA has a Policy for Diagnostics Testing for Coronavirus Disease-2019 that says how labs that develop a test should do an ""emergency validation"". They can then get Emergency Use Approval.  


Sensitivity tells us: of all truly Covid-19-positive specimen, which percentage is correctly recognized as positive by the test; I'm going to use  87.5 % (see below)
Specificity tells us: of all specimen that are truly negative for Covid-19, which percentage is correctly recognized by the test.


Sensitivity and specificity can be measured by standardized protocols, and they characterize the performance of the test. 

From a patient's or doctor's point of view, however, they are not very useful numbers as they (we) need the answer to the inverse questions:

Predictive values


positive predictive value PPV: given that the test yielded positive, what is the probability that the patient truly has the virus?
negative predictive value NPV: given that the test yielded negative, what is the probability that the patient truly does not have the virus?


Predictive values can be calculated from sensitivity and specificity together with the prevalence (or, as we are talking about newly infected patients, the incidence) of virus among the tested population. Here's how they go for the assumed sensitivity and specificity:


red for positive test outcomes, dark green for negative test outcomes. posterior probability = after the test said something, what is the probability that the test result is correct = NPV for negative test result, PPV for positive test result.

Good estimates of prevalence are often difficult to obtain, because we need the prevalence among those who are tested and that is (and should be) quite different from the prevalence of the disease in the general population. 

For some countries such as Italy, we have numbers of performed tests (Wiki page giving numbers for more countries): as of today (March 14th), they ran 109170 tests and have a total of 21157 cases. Not all tests are for initial diagnosis (AFAIK, a patient is considered cured only after a bunch of tests are negative), but as most cases are still ""fresh"", we may the ratio positive cases : tests run as one surrogate for the prevalence in the tested population. This would be around 20 % for Italy. 

From the diagram we can then read for a new patient being tested the first time:


if the test outcome is positive, chances are ≈ 75 % (or greater as I'm calcluating with the lower end of the possible range from the emergency validation) that the patient really has Covid-19.
So, up to 25 % false positives. 
if the test outcome is negative, chances are ≈ 95 % (or greater...) that the patient really does not have Covid-19.
So, up to 5 % false negatives. 


Canada currently reports 25 positive out of a total of 796 tests, so about 3 % prevalence in the tested population.

For the USA, the CDC reports case numbers and test numbers, currently 1629 cases with (3995 + 15749) tests - but it is not entirely clear to me whether the populations completely coincide. Anyways, I'll use 8 % as guesstimate for prevalence.

| prevalence |  PPV |    NPV | Country/Population | 
+------------+------+--------+--------------------+
| 3 %        | 26 % | 99.6 % | Canada             |
| 8-9 % (?)  | 50 % | 98.8 % | USA, Germany       |
| 20 %       | 75 % | 95   % | Italy              |



Now that is the population of ""everyone who is tested"". At least for Germany (March 14th) but probably also for Canada and the US, tests are done on people who show symptoms and on people that are known to have had contact with Corona virus cases: if they are found to be positive, they are sent home to quarantine and wait whether they did acutally catch the disease. But we may still say that the ""people who are tested"" population has subpopulations with and without symptoms.
So if there are further point of suspicion, say, the patient does cough, we'd say they belong to a high risk subpopulation with higher prevalence of Covid-19 compared to the overall prevalence among tested, so the chance of a false positive would be lower for them.  

This will change as tests are performed only on people who show symptoms (by now, March 16th, everyone is already  told to stay at home in Germany and self-isolate as well as possible - the test result will not change this in any way).  

Handy for quick calculation: likelihood ratio positive (LR+) and negative (LR-)

If we express the prevalence as odds (1 : 99 instead of 1 %), LR+ and LR- allow easy back-of-the envelope calculations. 

LR+ = sensitivity / (1 - specificity) ≈ 11 or better for our test and 
LR- = (1 - sensitivity) / specificity ≈ 0.05 = 1/20 or better for our test.

so they are indpendent of the prevalence and they tell us how the odds change due to the test: the posterior probability (predictive values) are the the pre-test odds multiplied with the likelihood ratio. In that sense, they tell us how much information we gain due to test (for positive and negative outcomes).

So, Canada reported odds of 25 positive : 771 negative tests. So for Sophie Trudeau, the odds went from 25 : 771 (or 3 %) to  25 : 771 * 11 = 273 : 771 ≈ 1 : 3 or 25 %. For Justin Trudeau 25 : 771 / 20 = 25 : 15420 ≈ 1 : 617 or 0.16 % of being Covid-19 positive (slight discrepancy to above due to rounding).

On the other hand, if we start testing more and more people for whom the risk of actcually having contracted the virus is lower and lower, we soon won't be able to draw meaningful conclusions from the test results any more: I'm in Germany, currently the federal info page lists 3800 confirmed cases. Even if we assume that there is a huge dark figure and in reality 20 x as many people are infected* that would be a prevalence in the general population of 0.1 %, the odds are 1 infected : 1.5 mio non-infected. If someone who does not belong to any particular risk group were tested positive, their odds would increase by factor 11, i.e. roughly 1 : 140000. A negative test result would decrease the odds by a factor of 1/20 to 1 : 31 mio. However, both results are of no practical use as they don't change the situation: pre-test situation is ""very unlikely to be Covid-19 case"", post-test situation is still ""very unlikely to be Covid-19 case"".

This is why, even if there were testing capacities for the whole population, tests don't make sense unless we know there are some risk factors such as some kind of respiratory disease or contact to someone who is known to have the virus. And why it is sensible to say that on slightly suspicious circumstances (= low, but not extremely low prevalence), one should self-quarantine/avoid contact but there's no point in testing [yet].



Detais on how I estimate sensitivity and specificity


The lab first determines the limit of detection (LoD) for virus RNA. The LoD here is the lowest concentration at which 19 out of 20 replicate tests are positive (that would be 95 % sensitivity, but for samples spiked in the lab, but with a relevant and as difficult as possible matrix such as sputum). 
Next, [leftover] clinical samples are used: 


As there may not be any positive samples available, the lab can spike negative samples with virus RNA; a minimum of 20 samples are spiked within a range of 1 - 2 LoD plus 10 samples to cover the remaining clinical range.
Of these, at most 1 is allowed to have negative outcome (and that must be one in the lower concentration range). Thus, 29 positive out of 30 true positive. 
Also 30 non-reactive specimens are tested. The policy doesn't say a number of false positives that is permissible, so I'm going to assume that must be zero.  

The lab can then start with real patient samples. The first 5 positive and the first 5 negative cases must be confirmed by an approved test (and must all match). 


Pooling the 2 ""rounds"" of testing clinical samples, we have:


34 (or 35) positive tests out of 35 truly positive specimen -> sensitivity at least 97 % with 95% credible interval 87.5 - 100 %,
specficity 100 % with 95% credible interval 92 - 100 %
There are additional checks required but they don't help us here.
Sampling errors are not included in this validation.
I'm not a clinical chemist, but I'm analytical chemist and in general analytical chemistry, that can easily be the dominating source of error. In that case, the above numbers would be useless.
Particularly the sensitivity may drop over time as the virus mutates. 
To deal with this, in some cases multiple tests are done (read that in some newspaper article which I don't find at the moment).
When doing multiple tests, tests by different providers are used if possible: as they are developed from different virus samples, this gives a better coverage for mutations in the virus than doing the same test in replicate.

SARS was also spread by one patient with diarhoea with malfunctioning sewer systems aerolized the virus across multiple floors of a building.


  Both the Covid-19 and the SARS viruses had an aerosol half-life of 2.7 hours, meaning half the particles drop out of the air after that amount of time, and half of what remains drop out after another 2.7 hours. After a day, roughly nine half-lives, 0.002 (0.2 of 1%) of the original particles remain. As a result, the scientists said, “aerosol … transmission of [the new coronavirus] is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours.”


The usual spread may be via contaminated surfaces (probably on the cruise ships) and respiratory transmission less so since the rate of symptomatic infection among a patient’s household members was 10.5%

How PCOS develops is not fully understood, but there are three main processes going on that give rise to the possible symptoms of irregular periods and ovulation, excessive hair growth but with thinning scalp hair, weight gain and oily skin or acne.

These three processes are below, adapted from this article):


An alteration in gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion results in increased luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. This is what can affect the normal menstrual cycle and ovulation.
An alteration in insulin secretion and insulin action results in hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. This is associated with weight gain and a higher risk of diabetes.
A defect in androgen synthesis that results in increased ovarian androgen production. This refers to testosterone, which is what causes symptoms of excess hair growth and oily skin.


While a high LH can be associated with PCOS, one might expect testosterone levels to be raised (though there are different ways to measure this and it can need some interpretation). Not all women experience all of the symptoms, and there is great variation in severity. The next step would usually be an ultrasound scan of the ovaries to look for multiple cysts.

There are diagnostic criteria from the AE-PCOS Society (2009), which I have simplified a little here:


Elevated testosterone plus either:
Fewer than 6-9 periods per year (oligomenorrhoea) or

21342,Is the washing hands in order to protect yourself from COVID-19 backed up by research?,"I have been hearing a lot of people say that it is recommended to wash your hands thoroughly in order to maximise protection against COVID-19 infection.

",21384,"Here's an article that I found helpful, to understand why washing hands with soap is so helpful, and how it helps (Pall Thordarson is a professor of chemistry at the University of New South Wales, Sydney):


  Why does soap work so well on the Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus and
  indeed most viruses? The short story: because the virus is a
  self-assembled nanoparticle in which the weakest link is the lipid
  (fatty) bilayer. Soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls
  apart like a house of cards and dies – or rather, we should say it
  becomes inactive as viruses aren’t really alive.
  
  The slightly longer story is that most viruses consist of three key
  building blocks: ribonucleic acid (RNA), proteins and lipids. A
  virus-infected cell makes lots of these building blocks, which then
  spontaneously self-assemble to form the virus. Critically, there are
  no strong covalent bonds holding these units together, which means you
  do not necessarily need harsh chemicals to split those units apart.
  When an infected cell dies, all these new viruses escape and go on to
  infect other cells. Some end up also in the airways of lungs.
  
  When you cough, or especially when you sneeze, tiny droplets from the
  airways can fly up to 10 metres. The larger ones are thought to be the
  main coronavirus carriers and they can go at least two metres.
  
  These tiny droplets end on surfaces and often dry out quickly. But the
  viruses remain active. Human skin is an ideal surface for a virus. It
  is “organic” and the proteins and fatty acids in the dead cells on the
  surface interact with the virus.
  
  When you touch, say, a steel surface with a virus particle on it, it
  will stick to your skin and hence get transferred on to your hands. If
  you then touch your face, especially your eyes, nostrils or mouth, you
  can get infected. And it turns out that most people touch their face
  once every two to five minutes.
  
  Washing the virus off with water alone might work. But water is not
  good at competing with the strong, glue-like interactions between the
  skin and the virus. Water isn’t enough.
  
  Soapy water is totally different. Soap contains fat-like substances
  known as amphiphiles, some of which are structurally very similar to
  the lipids in the virus membrane. The soap molecules “compete” with
  the lipids in the virus membrane. This is more or less how soap also
  removes normal dirt from the skin.
  
  The soap not only loosens the “glue” between the virus and the skin
  but also the Velcro-like interactions that hold the proteins, lipids
  and RNA in the virus together.
  
  Alcohol-based products, which pretty much includes all “disinfectant”
  products, contain a high-percentage alcohol solution (typically 60-80%
  ethanol) and kill viruses in a similar fashion. But soap is better
  because you only need a fairly small amount of soapy water, which,
  with rubbing, covers your entire hand easily. Whereas you need to
  literally soak the virus in ethanol for a brief moment, and wipes or
  rubbing a gel on the hands does not guarantee that you soak every
  corner of the skin on your hands effectively enough.
  
  So, soap is the best, but do please use alcohol-based sanitiser when
  soap is not handy or practical.

21354,Do vaccines slow the spread of disease or do they reduce the severity of the disease?,"I have been reading about the spread of virus and understand comparisons that are being made with the flu.  The flu propagates through a population with vaccinated people while a new virus has an unvaccinated population.  I would like to understand the limitations of using data from the flu and making inferences to dealing with Covid19 given their populations are fundamentally different.

When you look at how contagious a virus is they talk about transmission rates without indicating if the rate is the base rate or the effective rate.  The flu and Covid19 have similar base rates, however 40% of the US population is vaccinated from the flu.  Does that mean that the flu actually has a much higher transmission rate in un-vaccinated people and the average works out to a number similar to Covid19 in an unvaccinated population?  Or does in mean that vaccine doesn't stop the spread as much as it really stops the disease?
",21362,"Reproduction numbers

First of all, the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) refers to the contageous person meeting susceptible people only:  the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. So $R_0$ is not affected by vaccination status (or acquired immunity) of the population, but it includes factors such as being contageous already during incubation period (i.e. while still free of symptoms, how contageous a single virus particle is, how long a virus particle lasts under ""normal"" circumstances, ...)

In contrast, the effective reproduction number R includes the effects of vaccination, acquired immunity, behaviour and other measures to reduce infection risk.

The wiki page linked above lists $R_0$ for Covid-19 as 1.4–3.9 and for the Spanish flu of 1918 as 2–3.

Now, for the countries that still have just a few Covid-19 cases and that are just beginning to take measures to slow the spread, the effective reproduction number will be roughly the same as the basic reproduction number: noone is immune yet, and no measures to reduce the number of contacts yet. 


  Does that mean that the flu actually has a much higher transmission rate in un-vaccinated people and the average works out to a number similar to Covid19 in an unvaccinated population?


Sort-of, but rather the other way round: it means that the effective reproduction number is lower for the flu even though their $R_0$s are similar. 

This review paper gives an R of about 1.8 for the 1918 flu and about 1.3 for the ""normal"" seasonal flu.



Vaccination


  Or does in mean that vaccine doesn't stop the spread as much as it really stops the disease?


That can also happen. Of course, the best and intended outcome of vaccination is that the acquired immunity is sufficient to prevent infection. Which means that the vaccinated person cannot spread the disease. However, not all vaccinatione we have and use achieve this - we still use them if they greatly reduce the severity of the disease. E.g. even with varicella vaccination 10 - 30 % of the exposed to get chickenpox (but even with them, serious disease is avoided). 

For the flu, the difficulty is that new strains appear regularly. This is also the reason why flu vaccination is done annually with a newly developed vaccine while e.g. for MMRV, pertussis, polio boosting with the existing vaccine every 10 years is sufficient (immunity actually may last even longer, up to lifelong*, but that varies by person, and since many vaccines haven't been around that long, we don't know for which that is the case).  In fact, flu strains appear so often that the development of the annual flu vaccine includes educated guesses which strains are going to be important for next season. Sometimes that guess is off. Wikipedia on flu vaccination has a table giving  effectiveness (actual reduction of infection risk) between 10 - 60 % for different years.
Even if the acquired immunity by vaccination is for the wrong strain, one may still benefit from cross-immunity(?) in that the disease will be milder and possibly shorter.



* also acquired immunity after a disesase does not always last life-long, e.g. a pertussis infection will achieve immunity for 4 - 20 years only (4 - 12 years for vaccination)
",Accepted,"Drinking water during or after a meal actually aids digestion. Water and other liquids help break down food so that your body can absorb the nutrients. Water also softens stools, which helps prevent constipation.

Despite the fact that it aids digestion, it also has its down-side such as the fact that it would slow the digestion process and reduce the body’s ability to produce enough digestive enzymes to digest foods properly. Without proper digestion, a build up of toxic waste can occur no matter what you are eating.

It is important to note that drinking water during a meal would be more beneficial than not drinking while eating if you are not properly hydrated before hand. Eating while dehydrated can cause the body to have a very tough time digesting food.

Based on the information presented, when thinking about how to approach eating meals yourself, there are several tips we can apply. It appears most beneficial to stay hydrated throughout the day and if you must drink while you eat, avoid drinking too much, as well as alcohol and acidic drinks. Drink warm water and drink it sparingly. A small glass will likely not interfere with digestion and by adding a dash of apple cider vinegar or lemon, you can aid in the digestive process further. If you can, you might want to try drinking 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after a meal with no drinking during, see how you feel. If it works for you, then stick with what works, if not, adjust accordingly.

",21369,"For the COVID-19 coronavirus, the first step of infection occurs in the lungs, when a protein on the surface of the virus binds to a receptor protein on a lung cell. This viral protein is called the spike protein (Wrapp, et al. 2020), and the receptor is known as ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2).

Before proteins can do their work, they need to assemble themselves. This self-assembly is what is called ""folding"" and there are many, many different ways proteins can fold.

An antibody is a type of folded protein that can block the spike protein from binding to its receptor, therefore preventing the virus from infecting the lung cell.


  Folding refers to the way human protein folds in the cells that make up your body. We rely on the proteins to keep us healthy and they assemble themselves by folding. But when they misfold, there can be serious consequences to a person’s health. (Source: Folding@home Homepage)

",Accepted,"There hasn't been any conclusive clinical studies that have found that vibrating belts, or any vibration exercise for that matter, can definitely help promote weight loss. Sadly, most studies have been done on full body vibration training, so some of the references I point to may not be specifically about vibration belts, but the mechanisms of each method are basically the same.

A review of several studies1 on vibration exercise in general, including the use of vibration belts, found that vibration exercise was not very efficient in burning fat. It wasn't found to be very good at promoting weight loss or changing the body composition at all (ie: building muscle). One study did show possible signs that vibration exercise and vibration belts can burn fat, but overall, the rate at which fat is burned at when using a vibration belt or other form of vibration exercise is low. There are some possible benefits of vibration exercise, such as higher oxygen intake. This review did not provide fully conclusive results, though.

Another review of many studies on whole-body vibration training2 found similar results, though they did point more in the favor of vibration exercise having benefits. The review states in its conclusion that:


  [Whole-body vibration training] appears to be associated with three pathways involved in weight loss: inhibition of adipogenesis and reduction of fat mass, increased energy expenditure, and increase in muscle mass. After analysing the literature, none of the results for the proposed pathways are consistent, and indeed are often contradictory.


This review shows more positive results than the other review I mentioned that vibration training may promote weight loss, especially when used in conjunction with other exercises meant to help you lose weight. Vibration exercise does appear to be safe, though, so it can be used with a weight loss diet and exercises to help promote weight loss. Though this review was about whole-body vibration training, vibration belts work in a similar fashion, so it is likely that vibration belts may produce similar results.

In the sense that OP is probably considering, it isn't true. Counterexample, see below (and there are also other uses we put viruses to).
In a wider sense, life is always destructive in that a living organism uses energy, substances, and space that otherwise could be used by another living organism. While we could debate whether viruses are alive or not, they certainly share these points.
So a bacteriophage (see below) may be destructive to the bacterium it infects. But that bacterium dying means the ""neighbor strain"" that is resistant against this phage is thriving. So one organism's destruction eases the life of other organisms.
In that sense, I consider the claim of desctructivity with ""so, what?""





  can we create a virus like a thing to work for good in our body


Have a look at bacteriophages and phage therapy.
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria, and there has been research about using them against bacterial infections about 100 years ago, in parallel to the development of antibiotics. 

Besides political/language difficulties (bacteriophage research was strong in the Soviet Union, and in consquence lots of the research publications are in Russian) back then antibiotics turned out to be easier and cheaper in practice (this may change with increasing antibiotic resistances, though).

Antibiotics are produced by chemical synthesis or isolation from plant/fungi. They are chemical substances, so once we have studies that show that the stuff works as intended, product testing ""only"" needs to show that the correct modification of the correct substances is there in the correct concentration.  

But the viruses are more-or-less alive, and in any case they evolve. So chemical substance testing is not sufficient, for each batch the biological activity must be checked and proved anew. This means a lot of expensive work for each batch of the virus.
Also, the bacteriophages are pretty much the opposite of a broad-spectrum antibiotic: they are not only species specific but also strain specfic (I don't know whether that is the case always, often, or sufficiently often to hinder practical application).

How are screening tests different from what is done now.

(Slight disclaimer: I'm in Germany, so I know most details about the strategy here. AFAIK, it isn't that different in the US, though. At least, also here people are complaining that they get tests refused and people are talking that test capacities are not unlimited - but it's not clear to me whether people are sent home who should be tested according to a doctor ordering that test or only those who go/drive to the test centers because they think they should be tested.)

What is done right now in most countries (including Italy, Germany, South Korea) is testing populations that are at a non-negligible risk of having contracted the virus. Looking at the current (Mar 19) numbers of positive tests among all tests (Germany) and using LR+ of better than 20  (below in parentheses)and expected 61 and LR- of better than 1/20 (below in parentheses), expected 1/61 (see long explanation here)

            | pos tests/tests | PPV         | 1-NPV
------------+-----------------+-------------+------------------
USA         |          11   % | 88 % (72 %) |  0.2  % (0.6  %)

South Korea |           2.8 % | 64 % (36 %) |  0.05 % (0.01 %) 


PPV = probability of having SARS-CoV-2 after the test was positive
1-NPV = probability of having SARS-CoV-2 after the test was negative  

(There's the implicit assumption that everyone is tested with that same test - which is not true, the South Koreans by now may have better validation data, but I don't know this)

Screening means testing the normal population, which (still) has much lower prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Assuming the dark number is 99 x the known case count (i.e. we have 100x as many infected as positive test results),

            | 100*cases/inhabitants | PPV            | 1-NPV
------------+-----------------------+----------------+------------------
low risk    | 1 in 10000 =   0.01 % | 0.6 % ( 0.2 %) | &lt;0.01 %

With that assumed large dark numbers, Germany and South Korea would both have prevalences by now where using the existing test on the general population would start to make sense, as that would mean only 1 false positive case per true positive case. On the other hand, with prevalence in the single digit percent we'd be in the region where Frieden argues that testing of the general population doesn't make sense because it makes more sense to tell people to stay at home and away from contacts (which is the case for Germany - and since the numbers aren't growing as fast in South Korea, their dark number is probably much lower). 

In the low risk population (where Frieden says testing would make sense), we'd have only correct 1 out of about 200 positive cases. The PPV is for many practical considerations too low: screening needs very good tests, with very high sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity, because it is crucial here not to overlook truly positive cases, and specificity because the true positives  are otherwise hidden in army of false positives. 

To some extent, it is often possible to trade in some sensitivity for speificity and vice versa, e.g. with HIV test for blood donors, we do exactly this: we choose a very high sensitivity (so we can be sure not to infect anyone), and accept low specificity. So low, that a blood donor with positive HIV test isn't even told that they were tested positive. Instead, another test is applied (preferably by another manufacturer, because that adds more information than duplicate testing with the same kit), and if that is still positive, yet another one (a more elaborate one). After that IIRC it is still more probable that the blood donor does not have HIV, but they's be looking into it and taking anothe blood sample. 
(And the decision for the donated blood is anyways to throw it away just to be on the safe side). 

In principle we could do the same for SARS-CoV-2. Chaining lab tests would mean an enormous burden to the health system of dealing with false positives (and possibly re-testing people) at a time where we don't have unlimited health resources and where the probability that the false positive anyways catches the virus next day or so is non-negligible. This makes this strategy that starts from testing low risk population a complete waste of ressources (even if we had unlimited capacity for testing). This may change in the future when we have tests where proper full validation has shown that they have very good specificity and a useful sensitivity.

What we do currently, isn't very different though in principle:
We do currently chain two independent tests, just that the lab test comes 2nd: first a doctor comes and tests whether you are high risk group because you had contact with confirmed cases (maybe even 2nd order contacts) or you show symptoms. Then comes the lab test. 

Now the Germany* line in the table above is an interesting additional point. The prevalence there is from the influenza sentinel data from week 11 (last week). These are samples collected from people who were not sent to SARS-CoV-2 tests, but who went to a doctor with flu-like symptoms. 1 out of 251 was SARS-CoV-2 positive (and also influenza positive). The practically important point is: what did we miss because that SARS-CoV-2 case was overlooked (or would have been, had they not been in the sentinel sampling)? Actually, nothing: someone with the flu is told to stay at home and not infect anyone else pretty much like someone with SARS-CoV-2 (particularly now since it would also relieve the health system if the seasonal influenza would be overcome a bit faster). 

Testing in areas with few infections

Frieden does not propose screening, though: he proposes testing people who have been in contact with infected ones. Which apparently did not work out in Seattle, from what I read due to a lack of tests - but it did work out in Germany where it allowed to completely stop the first (small) outbreak in January.

Here, the ""had (2nd order) contact to infected person"" is the first test in the chain. This is a containment strategy, not a delay strategy. 

In order for this to work, we need a two ""ingredients"": we must be able to trace the contacts (and better also 2nd order contacts), and people sent to quarantine must obey this quarantine. 

Comparison Germany - South Korea (mainly)

... the US is left as excercise to the informed reader


South Korea apparently makes extensive use of autamated tracing of people in a fashion that would be completely unconstitutional in Germany.  
South Korea does use social distancing: according to Wikipedia they also shut down kindergardens, schools, and universities postponed their semester start. It did not have quite the same impact on overall economy that we see in Germany now. Their shutdown apparently was not all over the country, but earlier: they did that when they had 1000 cases.  
Apparently the population did a whole lot of that volountarily: the wiki page says the streets of Daegu were empty on Feb 20 (when they had a total of 100 cases).
In contrast, Germany now has 15 k cases, and pretty much an official shutdown since the weekend in terms of kindergardens/schools/universities, pubs/clubs/... and apparently there is a sizeable sub-population that gives in to the urgent need of having their own big (!) parties since pubs are closed.
(I can only speak from what I read in the news, I live in rural Germany where my sports clubs canceled everything - but the neighbors had a 4 generation party (not that many people, but...) for their new house yesterday. (OTOH, we have 8.5 confirmed cases per 100k inhabitants here, so even with that factor 100 for dark number, we're still below 1 % prevalence now) 
What seems to be similar: in South Korea young adults are the ones who spread the virus. Similar in Germany (more middle-aged initially [those who can afford to make skiing holidays in the Alps], now the Corona-Parties are a young adult thing)
I believe East Asia is in general more on the alert than we were. MERS and SARS are cited as reasons, but of course overall high population density also means a permanently increased risk of infectious disesases.
The Wiki page about COVID-19 in South Korea indicates similar testing capacity for South Korea (10k tests/day; 51 mio inhabitants) and Germany (16k tests/day; 80 mio inhabitants)


Some countries with more or less flat curves and more or less testing (per mio inhabitants):


South Korea so far done about 6000 tests / mio inhabitants
Italy 7300 / mio (maybe a bit late, but the main thing that was late in Italy is that for a while they didn't realize they had SARS-CoV-2)
Japan only 117/mio - but they have a very slow growth, still less than 1000 cases and their curve is decidedly flattening. Japan distances socially since Feb 25th (incl. e.g. to stay at home and not go to a doctor with only mild cold-like symptoms) at 167 cases in the whole country.
Singapore practices certain measures of social distancing since late January when they had &lt; 10 cases. (Didn't find testing numbers, though)
Norway has 6440 tests/mio inhabitants. Hopeful look at curve suggests that a slight flattening may take place. They started their lockdown at ≈700 cases, a bit more than a week ago.
Germany has ≈2100 tests/mio. 100 k tests were done in week 11, current capacity is about 30 k tests/day (is currently ramping up).
(substantial flattening at the earliest expected in about 2 weeks)
USA: according to Wikipedia 300 / mio inhabitants, but the German newspaper cites 3.5x as many tests, that would be 1100 / mio inhabitants.
(The difference may be whether private lab tests are counted or not?)


The Dutch test

... is about antibodies whereas the other tests look for virus RNA. These tests again good for different things:


The Dutch test tells whether there has been sufficient exposure to the virus (and sufficient time thereafter) to build antibodies. (Once we know more about this, it may also tell whether one is immune against SARS-CoV-2)
As they say, this is also important for getting an idea about the dark numbers of people who have been infected, but had so mild symptoms they didn't realize it.
The other tests tell whether you currently have the virus (and are contagious). 
Screening for active cases needs this test - the more so as the antibody test may become positive only a while after one is already contagious. 


Simulitis

The Washington Post has simulations of the spread of a (easier, more basic) disease called simulitis with 4 scenarios, ranging from no measures at all over a not quite perfect quarantine to moderate and extensive social distancing (25 % and 10  % of the population run around as always, rest stays where they are). I highly recommend reading, but here are some runs I just did:



Brown are active cases, violet cured/immune and blue susceptible persons.

Important findig for this question: in the first part of the quarantine simulation, the quarantine worked an noone got out (1st hump). Note that this hump has roughly the same height as the moderate social distancing hump, and leaky quarantine is worse (though the simulation doesn't get any newly infected into a new quarantine - I'd say the quarantine situation may be less like real quarantine and more like totally closed borders vs. not-quite-free movement between two countries).

21481,Why do corticosteroids harm COVID-19 patients?,"This Science Daily article states that steroids could do more harm than good in treating coronavirus (COVID-19), referring to this The Lancet article. 


  Understanding the evidence for harm or benefit from corticosteroids in
  2019-nCoV is of immediate clinical importance.


It's unclear to me how exactly the use of corticosteroids (which is a common treatments for Asthma patients) can do harm other than the vague explanation of ""steroids also impair the immune system's ability to fight viruses"". 

How exactly does the use of steroids harm the body in case of fighting a virus such as SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) that causes COVID-19?
",21484,"One of the primary purposes of corticosteroids is to suppress immune activity and inflammation: that's exactly why they are used in asthma.

Of course the immune system has an actual job besides causing nuisance inflammation: fighting infection.

For some infections, the harm to the infected person caused by the immune reaction itself is worse than that of the pathogen itself, so steroids can help prevent damage or ease symptoms while the immune system continues to mount a response, without being hyperactive.

For others, immune suppression may be detrimental. 

Corticosteroids mediate the immune response by suppressing a variety of cytokines and increasing others, which influences activity circulating numbers of different immune cell populations. Cortisol binds the glucocorticoid receptor, causing numerous changes in gene expression, many of which are associated with the immune system. From Wikipedia:


  (cortisol) inhibits production of interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alpha, and tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper (Th)1 cells, but upregulates IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 by Th2 cells. This results in a shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection is believed to be a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response.


In other words, corticosteroids work by by suppressing the generalized killing/cleanup part of the immune system mediated by macrophages and CD8+ cells, while preserving the B-cell part of the immune system that produces specific antibodies and the neutrophils that phagocytose antibody- and complement-bound pathogens.

Immune reactions are incredibly complex, so some of these basics may be violated in certain circumstances (including prolonged rather than acute dosing), and I've left out a lot of the other related immune cells. See references below (and the Wikipedia pages linked above) for more:

",Accepted,"PT-141 (bremelanotide)


  To my knowledge, PT-141 is the only substance that has shown any promise in increasing libido, and that's only in the case of women with depressed sexual response. 


I think this is only partially correct. One question is how to you would go about operationalising libido in males? For example, one could argue that an intervention that gives a male an erection in the absence of any visual sexual stimuli is for all intents and purposes, an aphrodisiac. 

PT-141 (bremelanotide) does seem to have these properties:


  Evaluation of the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of subcutaneously administered PT-141, a melanocortin receptor agonist, in healthy male subjects and in patients with an inadequate response to Viagra®
  
  PT-141, a cyclic heptapeptide melanocortin analog, was evaluated following subcutaneous administration to healthy male subjects and to patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) who report an inadequate response to Viagra®. An inadequate response was defined for this study by patient report indicating that achievement of an erection suitable for vaginal penetration occurred ≤50% of the time while taking 100 mg Viagra®. Erectile responses were assessed by RigiScan™ in healthy subjects in the absence of visual sexual stimulation (VSS) and in ED patients in the presence of VSS. Doses ranging from 0.3 to 10 mg were administered to healthy male subjects, resulting in a statistically significant erectile response at doses greater than 1.0 mg. ED patients were treated with placebo, 4 or 6 mg PT-141 in a crossover design in the presence of VSS. The erectile response induced by PT-141 was statistically significant at both doses. PT-141 was safe and well tolerated in both studies. The erectogenic potential of PT-141, its tolerability profile and its ability to cause significant erections in patients who do not have an adequate response to a PDE5 inhibitor suggest that PT-141 may provide an alternative treatment for ED with a potentially broad patient base.
  
  If some pheromone were effective in increasing libido in men then I would've expected to see a huge market for it and perhaps big pharma creating products that combine PDE5 inhibitors like ""Viagra"" with pheromones. 


You're correct here. In fact, perhaps the closest currently available to this is concomitant administration of PT-141 with PDE-5 inhibitors:


  Co-administration of low doses of intranasal PT-141, a melanocortin receptor agonist, and sildenafil to men with erectile dysfunction results in an enhanced erectile response
  
  Objectives To evaluate the safety and pharmacodynamic effect of co-administration of subtherapeutic doses of PT-141, a cyclic heptapeptide melanocortin analogue, and sildenafil to patients with erectile dysfunction.
  
  Methods Nineteen patients with erectile dysfunction who were responders to either Viagra or Levitra by self-report were given 25 mg sildenafil and 7.5 mg intranasal PT-141, 25 mg sildenafil and an intranasal placebo spray, and a placebo tablet and an intranasal placebo spray in a randomized cross-over design. Erectile activity in response to two 30-minute episodes of visual sexual stimulation was assessed by RigiScan during a 6-hour postdose period.
  
  Results The erectile response induced by co-administration of PT-141 and sildenafil was significantly greater than the response elicited by administration of sildenafil alone. Co-administration of PT-141 and sildenafil was safe and well-tolerated and did not result in new adverse events or adverse events that were increased in frequency or severity compared with monotherapy.
  
  Conclusions Co-administration of intranasal PT-141 and a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor may constitute a treatment alternative for patients in whom higher doses of a single therapy are not effective or well tolerated.


EDIT:

As correctly pointed out to me, in the above, I have mischaracterised the presence of an erection with male libido. One should not confuse raging passions for getting a raging clue. This is not a trivial point:


  The Subjective Sexual Arousal Scale for Men (SSASM): Preliminary Development and Psychometric Validation of a Multidimensional Measure of Subjective Male Sexual Arousal 
  
  Male sexual arousal has been historically
  described as a central physiological state, with
  penile erection in a sexual context as its most valid
  objective measure [21]. Bancroft deﬁnes sexual
  arousal as a state that is motivated toward experi-
  encing sexual pleasure and possibly orgasm, which
  involves the processing of relevant stimuli, general
  arousal, incentive motivation, and genital response
  [22]. A multifaceted process of male sexual arousal
  is supported by functional magnetic resonance
  imaging data indicating different patterns of brain
  stimulation during sexual arousal, penile tumes-
  cence, and penile erection in healthy male volun-
  teers [23]. Furthermore, studies in men without
  sexual dysfunction have demonstrated that penile
  erection is not always highly associated with sub-
  jective mental aspects of sexual arousal [24,25].
  Based on these ﬁndings, a lack of subjective sexual
  arousal may explain why some men with ED fail to
  respond to treatment with PDE5 inhibitors
  despite having the physiological ability to achieve
  and maintain an erection.


However, my reference to the role of exogenous testosterone may more accurately reflect what is meant by ""libido"" or sexual desire.

Exogenous testosterone

Alternatively, you might have some measure of sexual interest in males, in which case administration of exogenous testosterone displays efficacy in this regard:


  The effects of exogenous testosterone on sexuality and mood of normal men 
  
  The effects of supraphysiological levels of testosterone, used for male contraception, on sexual behavior and mood were studied in a single-blind, placebo-controlled manner in a group of 31 normal men. After 4 weeks of baseline observations, the men were randomized into two groups: one group received 200 mg testosterone enanthate (TE) weekly by im injection for 8 weeks (Testosterone Only group), the other received placebo injections once weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by TE 200 mg weekly for the following 4 weeks (Placebo/Testosterone group). The testosterone administration increased trough plasma testosterone levels by 80%, compatible with peak testosterone levels 400-500% above baseline. Various aspects of sexuality were assessed using sexuality experience scales (SES) questionnaires at the end of each 4-week period while sexual activity and mood states were recorded by daily dairies and self-rating scales. In both groups there was a significant increase in scores in the Psychosexual Stimulation Scale of the SES (i.e. SES 2) following testosterone administration, but not with placebo. There were no changes in SES 3, which measures aspects of sexual interaction with the partner. In both groups there were no changes in frequency of sexual intercourse, masturbation, or penile erection on waking nor in any of the moods reported. The Placebo/Testosterone group showed an increase in self-reported interest in sex during testosterone treatment but not with placebo. The SES 2 results suggest that sexual awareness and arousability can be increased by supraphysiological levels of testosterone. However, these changes are not reflected in modifications of overt sexual behavior, which in eugonadal men may be more determined by sexual relationship factors. This contrasts with hypogonadal men, in whom testosterone replacement clearly stimulates sexual behavior. There was no evidence to suggest an alteration in any of the mood states studied, in particular those associated with increased aggression. We conclude that supraphysiological levels of testosterone maintained for up to 2 months can promote some aspects of sexual arousability without stimulating sexual activity in eugonadal men within stable heterosexual relationships. Raising testosterone does not increase self-reported ratings of aggressive feelings.


If we consider both testosterone and PT-141 in tandem, sexual awareness and sexual arousal can be dissociated from one another.

Dopaminergic stimulants e.g. meth/amphetamine

There is some evidence from animal studies to suggest that amphetamine increases libido, as operationalised by frequency of sex. Again, I could suffer from the same folly as above where I confuse libido for some other construct, but this is also supported by subjective reports among meth users who like to have sex with other dudes. However, I will need to dig up some references.


  Former Nobel laureates and other researchers at Harvard awarded the 2007 Ig Nobel Peace Prize to the creators of the ""gay bomb"" -- a non-lethal military weapon under development intended to induce demoralizing homosexual behavior with aphrodisiacs. 


If the above regarding amphetamines is correct, it would be hilarious to see what effect acute administration of methamphetamine among a male prison population would be. 

Marketability of aphrodisiacs in general

One problem is that the current milieu within which drugs are evaluated by the FDA is that a drug will only be approved for sale if it can treat a disease. Any use of the term ""aphrodisiac"" is effectively a no-no. What I imagine would happen is that eventually the diagnostic criteria for erectile dysfunction would be relaxed considerably, or some equivalent of sexual arousal disorder for males would enter into the vernacular.

I'm a little surprised that recreational use of some combination of testosterone/methamphetamine/PT-141/PDE-5 inhibitors as some sort of sex aid isn't ""a thing"". Well, I'm sure it is somewhere in the world.

",Accepted,"I viewed your question in the Biology Stack and I think the answers you received are quite good. I´ll try sum up those long answers in the Biology Stack and present them more clearly.

Major factor influencing to the presumed effects of any drug is the first pass effect (Wikipedia). That means that every substance taken orally must absorb from intestine to the surrounding blood stream. All this blood with all absorbed substance (incl. sugar, fat, protein from food) are transported to liver. Liver then processes all the substances in the blood.

There are dozen of enzymes in the liver which processes the substances in the blood. One enzyme family particularly processes all the foreign substances (inc. drugs) (Wikipedia). Liver aims to remove all foreign substances from the blood, but some of the absorbed substance always escapes the liver to the systemic circulation. Only those molecules which escape liver without processing are transported to the tissues and afterwards can bind to their receptors in the tissue thus eliciting the proposed actions (ie. reducing pain).

Enzymes in the liver processes the foreign molecules in a way that they are secreted to bile and eventually to feces. For example enzyme CYP2E1 processes paracetamol (Wikipedia). There are three different CYP-enzymes which processes diclofenac molecules (PubMed). And for naproxen two CYP-enzymes exist (PubMed). 

One major reason why diclofenac does not help you but naproxen does, is the different action of these enzymes. DNA in our cell nucleus defines how each protein is expressed in our body. These enzymes are these proteins. In your case it seems that enzymes responsible for processing diclofenac are expressed in large number in your liver, resulting to very low concentration of diclofenac molecules in your bloodstream. In other word the level of diclofenac in your blood stream is out of therapeutic window to elicit any responses in the body (Wikipedia). In contrary, your liver may express enzymes responsible for the processing of naproxen very little and thus many naproxen molecules may escape liver to the systematic circulation resulting the therapeutic level to elicit tissue responses.

This only one player in this topic, although very important and influential. There are also factor influencing after the first pass effect (receptor, expression of genes responsible for receptors, binding affinity ec.)

",21511,"Sorry this is a cut and paste answer from https://pharma.elsevier.com/pharma-rd/approaches-for-creating-a-covid-19-vaccine/


  Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, no one had ever heard of the causative agent 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2). There were no approved antivirals or vaccines for this virus or for any related coronaviruses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus).
  
  Problems with COVID-19 vaccine development
  
  Developing vaccines from scratch—which is required for COVID-19—is typically not a good option for stopping an ongoing pandemic. The extensive time required to develop a safe and effective vaccine that can prevent future disease in vaccine recipients (average of approximately 10 years) [1] means that the public health threat will end long before a candidate vaccine is licensed.
  
  Vaccine development requires extensive planning regarding vaccine design, vaccine production and purification, preclinical testing in animals (to ensure some safety in humans), and multiple phases of clinical trials in humans (phase 1 for safety and phases 2 and 3 for efficacy). Companies taking the risk and proceeding with vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 (at least 13 companies as of March 7, 2020) [2] are banking on the virus continuously circulating, so they have a population to conduct phase 2 and 3 trials with. If the virus disappears from circulation in China—or the perceived risk the virus poses to human health substantially declines—before phase 2 trials end, vaccine development will probably end.
  
  Vaccine design approaches
  
  Vaccines that are safe and stimulate the right immune responses that confer protection from disease are challenging to design. There are a number of different strategies companies have used: live attenuated or inactivated viruses, virus-like particles or other protein-based approaches, viral vector–­based vaccines or nucleic acid–based vaccines. Of the potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the pipeline, four involve nonreplicating viruses or protein constructs, four have nucleic acid–based designs, two contain live attenuated viruses and one involves a viral vector [2]. Regarding the previous SARS pandemic, one inactivated SARS-CoV [3] and one DNA-based vaccine [4] made it through phase 1 trials before vaccine development ended.
  
  The different approaches for vaccine design all carry different advantages and disadvantages [5]. Approaches involving replicating viruses stimulate robust immune responses, but safety is often a concern. Protein vaccines and nucleic acid–based vaccines are often safer but typically have less immunogenicity, and they require adjustments to induce stronger immune responses. Nucleic acid–based vaccines are typically the fastest to get into phase 1 studies, but no nucleic acid vaccine has been licensed for use in humans as of yet.
  
  Because of safety concerns involving older populations (who have higher risk for severe disease), using a live attenuated virus might not be the best approach [6]. Patients with severe disease typically have T-helper 2 responses (immune responses typically induced against extracellular parasites), so vaccines known to elicit this type of immune response (inactivated viruses, virus vectors) might also be best avoided. Vaccines involving protein-based (virus protein subunits, virus-like particles, nanoparticles) or nucleic acid–based (DNA or RNA encoding virus structural proteins) designs, which do not have known safety disadvantages, might be the best approaches for SARS-CoV-2.
  
  Unfortunately, our knowledge of the immune response is not advanced enough for us to accurately predict vaccine safety and efficacy. What we have to do (testing multiple different strategies) is exactly what is being done. Only with results from more extensive research will we know the absolute best approaches for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. 


Furthermore experts have said that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is heavily glycosalated so that potential immune epitopes are hidden from the immune system.
",Accepted,"Assuming the person is not taking anticoagulants, it's actually quite difficult to bleed to death from dismemberment of small members (hands, feet, penis, ears, nose, etc). Even large members such as arms and legs are often survivable because the body is very good at protecting itself from blood loss. For example, transected arteries will spasm and clamp off blood flow, and loss of blood will cause the body to divert blood flow away from the extremities and to the vital organs, thereby slowing the bleeding and allowing it to clot. In fact, the whole shock process can be viewed as a set of defensive measures by the body to ensure survival in the face of serious injury. This was a bitter lesson learned by emergency medicine only fairly recently. The standard practice used to be to infuse hypovolemic patients with fluids to maintain normal blood pressure. The trouble is, a normal blood pressure prevents the body from realizing it has inadequate blood volume and turns off its defensive measures, thus allowing the bleeding to continue unabated. 

Left to fend for himself, a healthy adult would almost certainly survive having his penis removed. With modern medical care, that becomes a certainty.

",Accepted,"What is uric acid? Uric acid is the final breakdown product of purine (essential components of DNA and RNA) degradation in humans. In plasma extracellular fluid and synovial fluid, uric acid is found in its ionised form called urate. When plasma is saturated with urate, urate crystal can precipitate. Similarly in urine, depending on the pH (acid vs basic), urate can precipitate and form renal stones.

According to the Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine,


  Mean serum urate values of adult men and premenopausal women are 415
  and 360 μmol/L (6.8 and 6 mg/dL), respectively. After menopause,
  values for women increase to approximate those of men. In adulthood,
  concentrations rise steadily over time and vary with height, body
  weight, blood pressure, renal function, and alcohol intake.


Increased production or decreased excretion of uric acid lead to hyperuricemia.


  Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma (or serum) urate concentration > 405 μmol/L (6.8 mg/dL).


A detailed list of causes of hyperuricemia can be found in the table below



The most common complications of hyperuricemia are:


gouty arthritis (the risk of developing gouty arthritis increases
with high serum irate levels) 
nephrolithiasis (= renal stones)
urate nephropathy (= monosodium urate crystal deposition in the renal
interstitium)
uric acid nephropathy (= uric acid crystals deposition in renal
collecting ducts, pelvis and ureters)


Detection of hyperuricemia relies on the patient's symptoms. Hyperuricemia can be asymptomatic and not necesseraly be associated to any disease. As such, evaluation of hyperuricemia will be guided by the clinical presentation and by the clinician's suspicion. Typically uric acid can be measured in the blood. Also, in some cases, quantification of uric acid excretion can help to investigate whether hyperuricemia is due to increased production or reduced excretion.

Finally, while in some cases, antihyperuricemia therapy is indicated, routine treatment of hyperuricemia is not recommended.
A systematic review (when authours review all the current scientific literature regarding a specific topic/question) conducted in 2014 regarding risk factors for gouty arthritis found following risk factors:


  Alcohol consumption increased the risk of incident gout, especially
  beer and hard liquor. Several dietary factors increased the risk of
  incident gout, including meat intake, seafood intake, sugar sweetened
  soft drinks, and consumption of foods high in fructose. Diary intake,
  folate intake and coffee consumption were each associated with a lower
  risk of incident gout and in some cases a lower rate of gout flares.
  Thiazide and loop diuretics were associated with higher risk of
  incident gout and higher rate of gout flares. Hypertension, renal
  insufficiency, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia,
  hyperuricemia, diabetes, obesity and early menopause were each
  associated with a higher risk of incident gout and/or gout flares.


So working on these risk factors should reduce the risk of developing hyperuricemia.

But given asymptomatic transmission and virus spread from contact with contaminated surfaces, how I can make sure I don't accidentally do more harm than good?

Is it enough to use hand sanitizer before I go to the store, then again use hand sanitizer when I unload the grocery bags from my car, and make sure I keep several meters of space between me and the person I deliver to? Should I wear a mask? Gloves?

I'm guessing most older people will want to pay in cash. Is it possible to decontaminate change (coins, bills), or is it safer to only accept exact payment?

Hand sanitizer and washing is primarily before eating to stop that virus transfer.

You can spray the outside packaging with a bleach solution to sterilize it if there's a possibility that it was contaminated at source, or the recipient can do that.

",21562,"Update Apr 2: Pooled tests are under development now (newspaper in German), the plan is to pool 5 samples and to use the usual amount of each sample (and presumably dilute less) so that sensitivity is not an issue. 



In general, pooled tests help in screening situations, that is, when very few samples are positive, so that 10+ samples can be pooled and still only a small fraction of pooled samples is positive. They require good sensitivity.  

We're not in a screening situation with the current SARS-CoV-2 testing, and pooling wouldn't help much right now - it would probably not be worth while the effort to develop and implment pooled tests. 



Long version:

(update: deleted newspaper hints that logistics may be the bottleneck:)


  What is the bottle neck in the testign process?


According to Kekulé (10 min or so into the interview) the ""lab machinery"" in Germany has a capacity of several 100k tests per day, but right now there are shortages in reagents but also e.g. in the swabs for taking samples (so, comparably low tech parts of the test). Pooled tests of course need just as many swabs (if not more: false negatives due to the sampling not picking up virus material is a concern, and the usual remedy is to take more swabs.)



Anything that comes now are my guesses as a professional from a neighbouring field: analytical chemistry). I don't have any first hand experience with PCR. 


  Does the amount of material needed to test for COVID-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material?


I expect the reagent needs to scale (mostly) with the number of performed tests. I also expect the amount of tested material to be the same (prescribed by the method/protocol) for each run. That is, when you pool n samples, you'd take only 1/n of material from each (In practice it may be better to pool and then take out 1/n of the pooled sample).  Update: The test described in the newspaper goes the opposite direction: they take n times the sample material in order to avoid trouble with low sensitivity. In consequence, this cannot be considered a ""derived"" ""variety"" of the 1-sample tests, it must be newly developed almost from scratch.


  Does the amount of time needed to test for COVID-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material?


Again: the tests, mor precisely the number of batches of tests since multiple tests can be processed in parallel. 


  Is the the nucleic acid amplification test still reliable enough, if the Virus RNA to be detected is dilluded among multiple samples?


(From here on, we're back inside my professional experience)

This I cannot answer since I don't know the typical concentration range of virus RNA in the samples of positive cases.  

The lowest concentration of virus RNA that can reliably be detected is called the limit of detection (LoD). In this context, reliably is 19 out of 20 validation samples at that concentration according to the emergency/""shortcut"" validation procedure of the FDA (I expect other parts of the world to have similar validation procedures right now). The rFDA has a page with tests that have this emergency approval](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#covid19ivd), and the Manufacturer information lists the LoD. 

One would relate the lower end of the typical concentration range to the LoD to calculate how many samples could be pooled without the test becoming unreliable. 
The linked news article hints that this may actually be a limiting factor. The test under development avoids this problem by using more sample material.



There's another limitation to how many samples one can sensibly pool. The aim of the procedure is to save tests. Thus, we need to set up the pooling so that only a small proportion of pooled tests is positive and a large fraction of cases can be ""closed"" as negative. 

Here's the fraction of pooled samples that is positive depending on the prevalence = fraction of positive samples and the number of samples that are pooled n:

  

Contours are every 10 %points. Dashed and dotted lines are the current fractions of positive samples for Germany and Italy.

From that, we can calculate how many samples we need to run (for every positive pooled sample, additional n tests) and from that the fraction of tests we save compared to testing each sample separately:



Contours here are right to left: 0, 25 %, 50 % and 75 % ""savings"".

So, at the current testing situation in Germany, pooling 4 samples would allow to save almost 60 % of tests. In Italy, pooling 3 samples would save less than 15 % of tests.

A pooled test would need its own validation and one would also do some additional development to get the required sensitivity (LoD) for the desired number of pooled samples, meaning more delay until pooled tests would be available. 

In addition, pooled tests alongside the single tests that are anyways needed would mean additional logistic burden in the labs.  

I don't think developing a pooled test would be worth while right now, the more so, as other measures would give similar or better relief:

Doing only 1 test per household would save about 50 % since the average size of a household in Germany is 2 without the need of any new test development.

The same is true for further concentrating the tests on the vulnerable/high risk population. 

Thus, pooled tests may help in the containment phase when they'd allow to test a larger number of possible contacts. 

Update: Getting back into containment phase is the aim of the current lockdown. 

We'd still have high requirements for sensitivity and specificity. This means, pooled tests would have helped most right at the beginning of the epidemic - but they always mean additional R&amp;D and also additional validation needs to be done (and part of the validation work btw. must be done in every single lab that wants to use the test) since they need to be implemented in addition to the single sample method. This means, they'll always be available only after the single sample method is established.
",Accepted,"Most wounds leave some kind of scar. It's just that we sometimes can't really tell because it's so small. 

Here's how wound healing generally works: 


Blood clots and forms a scab (this may not happen, for example in burns and puncture wounds that didn't draw blood 
White blood cells (macrophages) ""clean"" the wound - the wound may appear to be oozing some fluid. Blood flow increases, the macrophages produce growth factors. 
Blood flow increases more, red blood cells deliver more oxygen. Cells at the edge of the wound secrete collagen. The wound fills with tissue called granulation tissue. 
New skin grows over that tissue. 


These stages are called hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. This process can take weeks to years depending on size and location of the wound. 

Now, what's a scar? Scars look different from ""normal"" skin because of collagen. Collagen is a protein on the outside of the skin cells holding them together and making skin strong (it's also a major part of tendons). In normal skin the collagen sort of forms a ""criss-cross"" pattern, while in scar tissue it's more parallel. That probably comes from the wound healing process. 

In small wounds, you won't notice that the skin looks different because of that. In larger wounds, it's very apparent at first, though scars also start looking less noticeable with age.

Shift work however has been shown to increase the risk of some adverse health effects.  The following is a list of adverse health effects that have are commonly associated with those working shift work or working long hours:


Sleep


Scientific publications on the topic generally agree that working shift work or working long hours has adverse affects on sleep (1).  In particular the quantity of sleep may be reduced by up to 2 hours per day, with a reduction in REM and stage 2 sleep.


Fatigue


It is logical that decreased sleep will also lead to increased levels of fatigue.  Reports of fatigue among shift workers is very common, and remains an important, but vague symptom often a major cause of shift work intolerance.


Mental Health


There have been reports of increased anxiety and depression among shift workers.  The question of whether shift work causes increased psychiatric morbidity however is still an open question, as correlation doesn't always imply causation.


Cardiovascular Disorders


Scandinavian studies show that shift workers have a 40% increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including angina, hypertension and myocardial infarction.  It is thought this increase risk may be associated with disturbances in the circadian rhythm, increased stress, poor diet and lack of exercise.  


Reproductive Disorders


There is increasing evidence that shift work may lead to increased risk of spontaneous abortion, low birth weight and prematurity.

The risks of developing any of these adverse health affects from shift work may also depend on age, sex and personality.  Evidence shows older people are able to tolerate shift work less than younger people.

21625,Is there any upside of using N95 masks instead of N99 or N100 to protect against COVID-19?,"One of the most commonly used masks/recommended to protect against COVID-19 is N95. 

Is there any upside of using N95 masks instead of N99 or N100 to protect against COVID-19?

N95 which filter 95% of particulates, while N99 or N100 filter 99% and 99.97%, respectively.

For example:


  Health officials recommend medical staff wear so-called N95 masks because they filter out about 95% of all liquid or airborne particles.


The N95 equivalent in Europe is FFP2, the N99/100 equivalent in Europe is FFP3, and the N95 equivalent in South Korea is KF94.



Prior research:

https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus


  Infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Health that the N95 is still the recommended face mask for health professionals, because it has the capacity to filter out very small particles that could possibly contain the virus. “This is different than a surgical mask, which can only stop larger droplets,” says Dr. Adalja.


http://emag.medicalexpo.com/which-masks-actually-protect-against-coronavirus/


  In the United States, respirators must meet NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) standards. Within this standard, there are several classes of respirators depending on the degree of oil resistance:
  
  Class N: no oil resistance. A distinction is made between N95, N99 and N100. The number after the letter indicates the percentage of filtration of suspended particles


https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-face-masks-not-entirely-effective-2020-1


  When worn correctly, N95 respirators block out at least 95% of small airborne particles. So the respirators can filter out some droplets carrying coronavirus. The coronavirus itself measures between .05 and 0.2 microns in diameter, according to a recent article in The Lancet.

",21739,"Yes, there are several ""upsides"" as you put it. 


It's cheaper
It's easier to breath in
It's sufficient for catching particles smaller than it's actually designed for...


Now, that last point is what's important. According to 3M's own documentes on various types of filters and masks, it seem that there's an electrostatic effect between the layers of the filters and the particles hitting it. So:


filter ""grid"" does not have to be smaller than the particles themselves
Apparently because of the electrostatic effects, particles are attracted to - and prefer to stick to, the fibers of the filter. 


From [2]:


  Because of the various mechanisms by which particulate filtration occurs, the smallest particles are typically not the most difficult to filter. Most particulate filters have a region of lower filtration efficiency somewhere between 0.05-0.5 μm.1 Particles in this range are large enough to be less effectively pushed around by diffusion, but small enough to be less effectively captured by interception or impaction. The most penetrating particle size (MPPS) will depend on the filter media, air flow, and electrostatic charge on the particle. Filters that use electrostatic attraction may have a MPPS shifted to a slightly smaller size range.

The study Vitamin D effective ultraviolet wavelengths due to scattering in shade found that the UVB radiation at 280–320 nanometers that is needed for vitamin D production dropped to levels at around 50% in a tree shade and under an umbrella. It was much less on a covered veranda - around 11% - and completely absent in a car with closed windows.

Latitudinal Variations over Australia of the Solar UV-Radiation Exposures for Vitamin D3 in Shade Compared to Full Sun came to similar conclusions (emphasis mine):


  Using shade for UVD3 exposures can reduce total UV-radiation exposure by 37% to 58% compared to full sun UVD3 exposures. This research indicates that an improved approach to optimize UV-radiation exposures for the production of vitamin D3 is to use diffuse UV radiation under shade in and around the middle of the day.

Many persons feel ashamed wearing it, even those with symptoms. If everybody wears it, they do not feel ashamed and wear it.
As far as I know, one is (wrt covid19) contagious before developing symptoms. So if everybody wears the mask also these people do.


The two above points act as a collective protection.


Simple mask certainly will lower ""getting / spreading illness"" probability. Of course the ""holes"" (in a simple mask) are too big to prevent completely virus to enter (or get out when coughing), but it lowers probability! Even if it lowers the transmission probability by e.g. 5%, it might be a lot. As a hypothetical example: it might reduce R0 from 1.02 to 0.97 and so stop the virus spread so fast.

in Italy during the peak weeks of the flu epidemic of 2016–2017 was about 800 deaths/day.  This is way more than what is happening 
with Covid-19 now.  How come the health system is so stressed now?

Is it due to geographical distribution (Lombardy!) which Italy could not compensate by moving resources?  Or is it a different
distribution of deaths vs. being in intensive care?  Or what?
",21654,"The big difference in Italy today is that many younger, otherwise healthier patients need critical care and more generally that patients need critical care for a long time. These patients are not necessarily dying after they get care, but the extent to which the surviving patients require ventilators and supplemental oxygen is nothing like a seasonal flu and is likely inflating the death rate substantially among those who could otherwise be treated.

From NEJM: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005492


  Contributing to the resource scarcity is the prolonged intubation many of these patients require as they recover from pneumonia — often 15 to 20 days of mechanical ventilation, with several hours spent in the prone position and then, typically, a very slow weaning. In the midst of the outbreak’s peak in northern Italy, as physicians struggled to wean patients off ventilators while others developed severe respiratory decompensation, hospitals had to lower the age cutoff — from 80 to 75 at one hospital, for instance.

",Accepted,"Although it would be helpful if we knew what sort of pathology report this was, I surmise that it is likely describing analysis of a biopsy or surgically removed tissue specimen from a breast cancer.

In breast cancer, it has long been known that some but not all tumors express hormone receptors, particularly estrogen and progesterone. Although the mechanism is complicated, the basic idea is that estrogen can bind to the cells in the tumor and make it grow faster. For this reason, people with tumors expressing the estrogen receptor are often treated with hormonal therapy that blocks that hormonal stimulation. In pre-menopausal women, this is usually tamoxifen or a related drug, which blocks the receptors directly. In post-menopausal women, a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole, etc.) that block estrogen production are used. The important piece to note is that only tumors that express estrogen receptors respond to this type of hormonal treatment.

Partly because of the availability of these hormonal treatments, and perhaps partly due to the biology of the tumors themselves, breast cancer that expresses estrogen receptors tends to have a better prognosis than estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. Prognosis can refer to a variety of outcomes; in cancer studies it’s usually either survival or cancer-free survival. Patients with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer tend to fare better than those with estrogen-receptor negative tumors. Another way of stating that is: the presence of the estrogen-receptor has a favorable prognostic significance.

The pathology report (if I’ve got the context correct!) is saying that most (80%) of the cells in the specimen expressed the estrogen receptor. It then comments that this is known to be a favorable finding.

22831,With regard to COVID-19 what happens to droplets after coughing or sneezing?,"Let's say 15 minutes after a person coughs or sneezes, where does the droplet go? Up in the air and down to the ground? Is it different inside a building?
",22832,"Data suggests droplets remain in the air up to 3 hours, and longer for droplet nuclei.  Where they go depends on the local temperatures, humidity and air flows.



The image shows a cough on the left and a sneeze on the right.  


  Currently, the term droplet is often taken to refer to droplets >5 μm in diameter that fall rapidly to the ground under gravity, and therefore are transmitted only over a limited distance (e.g. ≤1 m). In contrast, the term droplet nuclei refers to droplets ≤5 μm in diameter that can remain suspended in air for significant periods of time, allowing them to be transmitted over distances >1 m (Stetzenbach, Buttner &amp; Cruz, 2004; Wong &amp; Leung, 2004). Other studies suggest slightly different definitions, with ranges for “large” droplets, “small” droplets and droplet nuclei being >60 μm in diameter, ≤60 μm in diameter and &lt;10 μm in diameter, respectively (Tang et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2007). The concept is that the naturally and artificially produced aerosols will contain a range of droplet sizes, whose motion will depend significantly on various environmental factors, such as gravity, the direction and strength of local airflows, temperature and relative humidity (which will affect both the size and mass of the droplet due to evaporation).


Oops, breathing and talking can produce droplets yet health authorities continue to claim that masks are not needed (to stop wearers from broadcasting droplets into the environment)


  Humans can produce respiratory aerosols (droplets) by several means, including breathing, talking, coughing (Figure C.1, A), sneezing (Figure C.1, B) and even singing (Wong, 2003; Toth et al., 2004).


We are being told that the main droplets are the larger ones being emitted but talking for 5 mins can produce droplet nuclei the same as a cough


  Published data have suggested that sneezing may produce as many as 40 000 droplets between 0.5–12 μm in diameter (Cole &amp; Cook, 1998; Tang et al., 2006) that may be expelled at speeds up to 100 m/s (Wells, 1955; Cole &amp; Cook, 1998), whereas coughing may produce up to 3000 droplet nuclei, about the same number as talking for five minutes (Cole &amp; Cook, 1998; Fitzgerald &amp; Haas, 2005; Tang et al., 2006). Despite the variety in size, large droplets comprise most of the total volume of expelled respiratory droplets. Further data on the behaviour of droplet dispersion in naturally generated aerosols are needed.


Small droplets fall to the ground where they dry up before they reach the ground but some become droplet nuclei on their way down which allows them to remain airborne


  In the classic study of airborne transmission, Wells (1934) was able to identify the difference between disease transmission via large droplets and by airborne routes. Wells found that, under normal air conditions, droplets smaller than 100 μm in diameter would completely dry out before falling approximately 2 m to the ground. This finding allowed the establishment of the theory of droplets and droplet nuclei transmission depending on the size of the infected droplet. The Wells evaporation-falling curve of droplets (see Figure C.2) is important in understanding airborne transmission and transmission by large droplets. Wells' study also demonstrated that droplets could transform into droplet nuclei by evaporation.


And what happens to droplet nuclei


  Droplet nuclei floating on the air may be carried by the movement of air. Entrainment of air into neighbouring airspaces may occur during the most innocuous daily activities; for example, as a result of people walking, or the opening of a door between a room and the adjacent corridor or space (Hayden et al., 1998; Edge, Paterson &amp; Settles, 2005; Tang et al., 2005, 2006). In addition, the air temperature (and therefore air density) differences across an open doorway will also cause air exchange to occur between the two areas, providing a second mechanism to allow air into other areas (Tang et al., 2005, 2006) (see Figure C.3).

  We found no evidence from the combined published studies that deodorant promotes development of breast cancer, despite in vitro evidence supporting the parabens hypothesis


This matter is also approached in a French study:


  Aucune étude prospective épidémiologique n’a, à ce jour,démontré cette hypothèse, mais l’angoisse générée par cesspéculations  pseudoscientifiques  amène  régulièrement  denombreuses patientes et femmes à questionner leur médecinsur l’innocuité d’utilisation de ces produits.

Even at Cancer.Gov they say:


  However, researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), a part of the National Institutes of Health, are not aware of any conclusive evidence linking the use of underarm antiperspirants or deodorants and the subsequent development of breast cancer. 


Overall, it seems safe to use deodorants. At least I haven't find any evidence otherwise.

22887,Transmission of COVID-19 through domesticated animals,"This is an exploratory question.

If a COVID-19 infected person (person is unaware that he is infected) milks the cow for couple of days, is there a possibility of him infecting the cow thereby infecting the milk?

Similarly, if a dog licks the face of COVID-19 infected person, is it possible that the virus may spread through its saliva to another person in the vicinity.
",22895,"

Covid-19 is the result of a zoonotic outbreak from bats to an intermediate ( and unidentified host ) thence to humans.  It is thought that bats don't suffer the disease themselves as they carry low levels of virus but the intermediate host modifies the virus, and amplifies it so that it vastly increases the amount of virus that can shed into the environment infecting humans.  One possible scenario is that bat coronavirus combined with a fish coronavirus inside the intermediate host.  This is based on the observation that the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene shares a 39-base insertion with a type of soldierfish that swims in the South China Sea.

The SARS-CoV-2 infects humans via the ACE2 surface receptor, but this receptor is not only found in humans.  Other animals have similar but not exactly the same ACE2 receptors and several dogs and one cat have returned positive swabs for SARS-CoV-2.  The cat developed covid-19 symptoms.  The first dog died two days after being released back to its owner but that might have been from the stress of quarantine in a 17 year old Pomeranian.  Ferrets also have an ACE2 receptor which also binds strongly to the SARS virus so presumably are also at risk. Mice appear to be less at risk.


  This is the first human-to-cat transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). About a week after its owner got sick with COVID-19, after returning from a trip to Northern Italy, the cat developed coronavirus symptoms: diarrhea, vomiting and respiratory issues, Steven Van Gucht, virologist and federal spokesperson for the coronavirus epidemic in Belgium, told Live Science.
  
  The owner sent samples of vomit and feces to Dr. Daniel Desmecht's lab at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Liège. Genetic tests showed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 in those samples, he said. ""The cat recovered after 9 days,"" Van Gucht said.


The Hong Kong Govt is now asking that pets of infected patients must now be quarantined for 14 days.

The CDC gives the following advice (which is out of date based on the above):


  If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed), you should restrict contact with pets and other animals, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. This can help ensure both you and your animals stay healthy.
  
  When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. Avoid contact with your pet including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with them. For more information visit: What to Do if You are Sick.


We don't have information on cows but presume that they may also be susceptible.

EDIT: Experimental data suggests cats are more susceptible to the virus than dogs


  The team, led by virologist Bu Zhigao, infected five domestic cats with SARS-CoV-2 through the nose. When two of the cats were euthanized six days later, the researchers found viral RNA, as well as infectious virus particles, in their upper respiratory tracts.
  
  The other three infected cats were put in cages next to three uninfected felines. The team later detected viral RNA in one of the non-infected cats, which suggests that they contracted the virus from the infected cats through respiratory droplets. All four cats also produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in cats should be considered as part of efforts to eliminate COVID-19 in humans, the authors note in the preprint, which has not been peer reviewed.


and


  Dogs, however, were less susceptible to the virus. The researchers infected five young dogs and found that two excreted viral RNA in faeces, but none contained infectious virus.
  
  Similar investigations in pigs, chickens and ducks identified no viral RNA in animals deliberately infected with the virus, or those exposed to the infected animals

The risk is compounded if you are not wearing proper protective equipment, washing your hands after handling them and covering breaks in skin before handling. Here is a list of the diseases you could end up with as well as a list of other fluids and how exposures can occur. 

If you would like to learn more and be able to better assist your patients, you should take first aid classes. Also, if you think that you have a high likelihood of coming in contact with blood or other fluids, you should consider carrying a pair of disposable medical gloves and safety glasses in your vehicle (or backpack... Something that is often with you).

If you live in an area that has fairly prompt ambulance response, you are much better off not trying to take the patients to the hospital. Instead, if it is safe to do so, try to redirect traffic around the patient so that they don't get hit again and try to keep bystanders a few feet back from the incident so that they do not get hit as well. Try to avoid completely stopping traffic as this can effect the emergency vehicle's ability to get to the scene. 

Your safety on scene is your priority, if you have the equipment, training to do so and ability to not get hit in the process, you should attempt to provide care to the patients. If any of those factors is not possible, you are much better off trying to keep the patient calm, keep bystanders at a distance - if possible - and try to keep the patient(s) from getting hit again.

22913,Use of antibiotics with chest infections,"I would like to have a confusing part of medicine cleared up. My experience of medical intervention is as follows.


As pointed out in the answer to Does taking antibiotics make you immune to virus? antibiotics do not work on viruses.
If I go to a doctor when suffering from the common cold, I am told to ride it out and take paracetamol for aches and pains. That makes sense as the common cold is caused by a virus.
If visiting the doctor because a chest infection arises however, a course of antibiotics is often prescribed.


How does a doctor manage to determine that the chest infection is a bacterial infection rather than a viral infection from the common cold virus?

If the bacterial infection arose out of a common cold infection, why is it the bacterial infection occurred and not a viral infection?
",22929,"This is actually a pretty complicated question because viral infections can damage the lungs in a way that makes subsequent bacterial infections possible/likely and it's often these that are fatal. So if co-occurring both may need to be treated, with different medications, or the viral infection may be ignored sometimes. It basically depends on the severity of the pneumonia (which I'm guessing it's what you mean by ""chest infection""). For some background on causes of pneumonia:


  Pneumonia is an infection of the lung that causes the alveoli, or air sacs, to fill up with fluid or pus. [...]  If pneumonia does not resolve it can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and decreased pulmonary function.
  
  There are several viral infections that lead to pneumonia (16). Influenza A virus (IAV) primarily infects the lung epithelium, and can cause viral pneumonia. [...] There are also a variety of other viruses that can infect the lower respiratory tract and lead to pneumonia, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, human metapneumonia, and some adenoviruses (14, 18–22). Rhinoviruses and newly described coronaviruses also infect the respiratory tract and cause disease. [...]
  
  A variety of bacteria can also lead to the development of pneumonia. Bacterial pathogens as well as opportunistic infections (also known as pathobionts) can lead to pneumonia when allowed to infect the lower respiratory region. Bacteria that cause LRTIs naturally colonize the nasopharynx, but can cause disease when allowed to proliferate in the lower respiratory region (24–28). The most common examples of these are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Other bacteria are acquired from the environment, and often these bacteria have specific virulence factors that allow for the adaptation and infection of the lower respiratory tract (29). [...]
  
  The vast majority of research in infection biology has been devoted to studying the interactions of a single pathogen with a host. In addition to single infections causing pneumonia, a common complication following infection with respiratory viruses is bacterial pneumonia (9, 26, 39–56).Many clinical infections and presumably subclinical infections are often in fact coinfections, in that two (or more) pathogens simultaneously or in close temporal proximity infect a single host (9, 26, 39–59). These infections are termed secondary infection, superinfection, or coinfection. The simultaneous response of two pathogens can manifest in many ways and often results in increased morbidity and mortality. 
  
  To determine the best treatment options for patients with complex viral/bacterial coinfections increased understanding of the interplay between pathogens and the interaction with the host is necessary. Several viruses and bacteria have been shown to interact to worsen clinical outcomes. It is now believed that most of the deaths associated with the 1918 influenza pandemic were caused by superinfection with bacteria (60, 61). IAV/S. pneumoniae coinfection is perhaps the most well-studied example of viral/bacterial coinfection of the lung (62). However, bacterial coinfection also complicates infection with other respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, metapneumonovirus, RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus (52, 63–66). Young children are especially vulnerable to bacterial complications following viral infection (44, 62, 67, 68).


So the NICE (i.e. UK) guidelines for diagnosing pneumonia say for example:


  Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a lower respiratory tract infection most commonly caused by bacteria; however, viruses are thought to cause approximately 13% of cases in adults, and approximately 66% of cases in children and young people. The main bacterial pathogen causing CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Haemophilus influenzae; epidemics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae occur approximately every 4 years in the UK, and mainly affect children.
  
  Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections is common in general practice. [...]


So if you are an adult suffering from pneumonia (the Covid-19 pandemic aside) chances are you more likely you have bacterial pneumonia.


  NG120 also emphasises the importance of face-to-face clinical examination in patients with acute cough if prescription of an antibiotic is being considered. Clinicians should therefore avoid issuing antibiotics for cough without a face-to-face examination. If bacterial pneumonia is suspected, it is important to assess the clinical signs and to determine their severity. [...]
  
  An antibiotic should be offered within 4 hours of establishing a diagnosis of pneumonia, and a 5-day course is considered appropriate in all severity gradings.


Also worth quoting from those guidelines:


  In practice, patients often return at the end of the antibiotic course due to concerns that symptoms have not resolved; however, in pneumonia, we should not expect symptom resolution at this stage. When issuing an antibiotic, it is important to explain to patients that their symptoms are highly unlikely to have resolved at the end of the course, but that the infection will have been adequately treated. It may be helpful to bear in mind that chest X-rays are not expected to return to normal for up to 6 weeks after pneumonia, reflecting the ongoing inflammatory rather than infective process.
  
  Sputum samples do not need to be routinely sent for patients with CAP treated in primary care. However, they can be useful if signs or symptoms have not improved as expected after antibiotic treatment, or in people who have previously had frequent courses of antibiotics, as this increases the likelihood of resistant organisms.


Basically, unless the pneumonia is severe enough (to require hospitalization), you won't get a test to determine the agent that caused it, unless the first course antibiotic doesn't resolve it.

I can tell you from general experience that the cause of pneumonia will get tested in severe cases in a hospital setting in almost any country. (There are probably some WHO guidelines for this, but I can't be bothered to search them now.)

Short coda on Covid-19:


  A study of 191 patients in two Wuhan hospitals showed that 50 percent of those who died tested positive for secondary infections compared to only one of the 137 survivors. In this situation, antibiotics form a crucial second line of defence. Many studies indicate that nearly all severe COVID-19 patients will receive antibiotics. 

",Accepted,"Dentures:

In general, there are two kinds of removable denture: Complete and Partial, indicating whether the denture replaces all or only some of the teeth. 

Purposes:


Restore or improve masticatory function (eating)
Restore or improve phonetics (speech)
Restore or improve esthetics (smile and appearance)


Keep in mind that the patient will need time to adjust to the dentures and that most dentures don't behave like the original teeth.

Design:

Their physical design which will determine the following:


stability (whether it uses extensions, clasps around teeth or attaches itself to implants to prevent it from moving side to side)
retention (whether it uses suction, clasps around remaining teeth or attaches itself to implants to prevent it from getting out of place vertically)
support (whether it rests on the gums, has rests to support itself on teeth or attaches itself to implants to resists vertical chewing forces)


Procedure:

The number of appointments depends on the work that needs to be done before making the denture. For example, The dentist will have to plan out the treatment, do filling, extractions or other surgeries (ex: place implants). As for the dentures,  it takes at the very least a few separate appointments depending on the treatment plan to get the right shape of the denture as well as the position of the teeth.

22937,Would the human seasonal coronaviruses be just as deadly as COVID-19 in a population with no prior immunity?,"Presuming that we were able to find a person who was never exposed to any of the human seasonal coronaviruses (part of the viruses that cause the common cold), would the virus be just as deadly for that person as the SARS-CoV-2 currently circulating around the world? Or is SARS-CoV-2  uniquely dangerous?
",22938,"The seasonal coronaviruses attach exclusively to cells with a ciliated epithelium.  


  Coronaviruses invade the respiratory tract via the nose. After an incubation period of about 3 days, they cause the symptoms of a common cold, including nasal obstruction, sneezing, runny nose, and occasionally cough (Figs. 60-1 and 60-2). The disease resolves in a few days, during which virus is shed in nasal secretions. There is some evidence that the respiratory coronaviruses can cause disease of the lower airways but it is unlikely that this is due to direct invasion. Other manifestations of disease such as multiple sclerosis have been attributed to these viruses but the evidence is not clear-cut.
  
  Studies in both organ cultures and human volunteers show that coronaviruses are extremely fastidious and grow only in differentiated respiratory epithelial cells. Infected cells become vacuolated, show damaged cilia, and may form syncytia. Cell damage triggers the production of inflammatory mediators, which increase nasal secretion and cause local inflammation and swelling. These responses in turn stimulate sneezing, obstruct the airway, and raise the temperature of the mucosa.


So, the mechanism of infection is such that they only attack the upper airways.

The SARS-CoV-2 is totally different.  It attaches to the ACE2 surface receptor which is found deep in aleolar pneumocytes.  Their damage causes loss of surfactant in the alveloi, the collapse of these air cells that perform oxygen exchange and subsequently ARDS.

So, seasonal coronaviruses give you a runny nose but don't kill.  SARS-Cov-2 collapses your air cells so you don't have any oxygen.

  Take these steps to monitor your health while you stay home and practice social distancing:
  
  Stay home, except to get medical care. Get rest and drink plenty of fluids.


...


  
  Get rest and drink plenty of water or clear liquids. Avoid alcohol or drinks with caffeine, such as sodas, tea, and coffee.
  


...

Why?

Why to avoid coffee?

And what would happen if I drink coffee?

What's the worst thing that could happen?
",22956,"At the very least, coffee (caffeine actually) can can have a complex interaction with pain medication. 

Caffeine can actually enhance the pain-relief effects of some medications, like aspirin, which is why it's included in some ""combo"" OTC painkillers in some countries. (But if you take these regularly and drink caffeinated drinks too, you may well exceed the daily RDA for caffeine, 400mg/day according to the FDA.)

However:


  Oddly enough, what makes caffeine effective in pain relief can also cause headaches.
  
  Since caffeine narrows the blood vessels that surround your brain, when you stop taking it they expand again, and that can cause pain.


I've also heard that if you don't take any pain meds, coffee will usually enhance your feeling of pain, but I can't find any (reliable) sources to back this up, even though in some circles it is recommended you don't drink caffeinated drinks when you have some (painful) medical (or quasi-medical e.g. tattoo, piercing, laser hair removal) procedures scheduled. YMMV. (Actually a 2018 paper found that habitual coffee drinkers have decreased sensitivity to pain.)

There are probably more aspects to consider including rigors and diuresis/sweating, both of which are probably modulated by caffeine. 

WebMD says (in an MD-reviewed article):


  These drinks won’t help you get over your cold or flu, and some could do more harm than good. [...]
  
  
  Coffee. If you’re going to sip a hot drink, might as well get your daily dose of caffeine in it, right? Wrong. Try to stick with water and nutrient-rich soups.
  


But rather disappointing they don't offer any reasons why coffee should be avoided in this case, except that it is inferior to ""nutrient-rich soups"". But this seems hardly a flu-specific argument, i.e. you can't expect your diet to be just coffee anyway.

The CDC flu [patient] guide makes a similar recommendation:


  If the sick person is not eating well, encourage
  them to drink liquids. Avoid alcohol or drinks
  with caffeine in them such as colas, tea, and
  coffee.


While apparently no reason whatsoever for avoiding coffee is given in there, this is put under the ""Tips to prevent dehydration"" heading, so it's probably due to sweating/diuresis being enhanced by caffeine. This seems to be a really controversial topic, e.g. a Time mag article cites some experts saying otherwise, so it's probably better left for a separate question.


  It’s true that caffeine is a mild diuretic, which means that it causes your kidneys to flush extra sodium and water from the body through urine. If you’re peeing frequently, and thus losing lots of liquid, it’s logical to think you could become dehydrated — but it actually doesn’t work that way, explains Dr. Daniel Vigil, an associate clinical professor of family medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles.
  
  “When you drink a cup of coffee or you drink a glass of iced tea, you are necessarily taking in a volume of fluid along with that dose of [caffeine],” Vigil says. Even though caffeine is a mild diuretic, Vigil says, you won’t lose more fluid through urine than you take in by drinking a caffeinated beverage. Your body is able to absorb as much fluid as it needs and expel the rest, he says.


Some studies seem to back up this latter view, but they involve healthy individuals.
",Accepted,"I seem to perceive some confusion in your question, and I'll try to clarify all doubts as much as I can. Olive oil is one of the best oils you can use to cook. It is mainly composed by monounsaturated fatty acids (1), that are neutral to cardiovascular risk and blood cholesterol. There are some oils that are better, by this point of view, like canola oil, that has a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, that are beneficial to cardiovascular risk. Some oils are worse, like palm oil, because of the higher proportion of saturated fatty acids, that are detrimental to cardiovascular risk. For the same reason you should also avoid margarines and butter.

Olive oil has also a high smoke point (2), that makes it suitable for frying. Smoke point is the temperature at which toxic compounds are formed; it means that you should never heat beyond smoke point of any oil. This is the reason why the dangerousness of very hot olive oil is not something specific of olive oil, but of any oil that is heated beyond its smoke point.

Finally, something that you should also be aware is that most of cooking oils are extracted with the use of hexane (3), a chemical solvent. Although the oil is subsequently refined, ""cleaned"", and the industry claims it's safe enough to be consumed, this procedure has risen a lot of concern.  ""Virgin"" and ""extra virgin"" olive oil do not involve the use of any solvent during the production; this characteristic is shared with other oils that are cold pressed. Cold pressing is an extraction technique that, additionally, preserves the chemical content of the polyphenols, antioxidants, and vitamins present in the oil, that are reduced by high temperatures. The regulation of the definition of ""virgin"" oils and cold pressing is different between countries.

And that may depend also on host factors.

In hospitals, in general, there are more older people.

Hospitals and nursing homes are environments where people live close together, so this is why infection can spread quickly among older people.

Younger people get infected in schools, when they travel to areas with lot of infected people and when they engage in contact sports, for example.

One of the reasons for a lot of cases in Italy is that they didn't act quickly when the inefction started.

",Accepted,"This thread explains the concept of calories well:


  Calories are energy. When you digest food, you are breaking down the bonds between each particle, releasing energy that is taken by the body to do work.
  
  From a mathematical standpoint, 1 Calorie = 1 Kilo calorie (scientific energy) = 1000 calories (notice the lowercase) = 4184 joules.


(See also: Wikipedia: Food Energy and ACS: Weighing in on Calories)

Water doesn't have any chemical bonds for your body to break down, so you're correct in that water doesn't have any calories. (USDA: Water has 0 calories.)

Your body does burn calories to bring any cold things you consume up to body temperature. For example, if you eat an ice cube, your body burns energy to melt it:


  If one considers that the human body must provide the heat necessary to melt them (around 6 kJ/mol, or 0.079 kcal/g if one substitutes for the molar weight of water) and to bring this (now liquid) water to the average temperature of the body (around 310 K or 37 degrees Celsius), at the average energetic cost of about 0.0755 kJ/mol/K or 0.001 kcal/g/K (constant pressure specific heat of water, source: NIST Chemistry Webbook), and if one supposes the average weight of an ice cube to be 10 grams, the energy supplied by ice cubes amounts to the respectable value of -1.17 (MINUS 1.17) kilocalories per ice cube, and this supposing that they are ingested at their melting temperature (0 Celsius). This means, for example, that the calories contained in the standard Coca-Cola (not Diet Coke!) can (330 mL) are completely eliminated just by adding 148 ice cubes to it.


(...In case the levity wasn't obvious, don't actually eat 148 ice cubes. That's probably a bad idea.)

This is supported by this article, in which Dr. Weiner discusses how eating ice burns calories. A note of caution: Although he concludes that ""the ingestion of one liter of ice per day appears to be generally safe"" (because Slurpees), he lists the following advisories:


Don't consume more than one litre of ice per day ""to avoid hypothermia or unusual cooling of the body"".
For similar reasons, be extra careful when eating ice during cold weather.
Don't chew ice, because it could crack your teeth, damage your gums or enamel, or injure your temporomandibular joint.
For children, the amount of ice ingested should be monitored and related to their body weight and ability to report any problems. Do not put ice into the mouths of children who can't tell you if their brain has frozen.

I'm thinking in the context of if it can survive a couple of weeks or a month in the mail for the recipient to get infected.

Edit:

I tried looking at the WHO's page dedicated to the virus, have not found anything pertaining to my question in the PDFs there (maybe I overlooked something, I guess I'm just lacking the proper keyword to use for the search)

I tried looking at the coronavirus Wikipedia page and have not found anything there.

I did find somewhere that a flu virus would typically not remain potent for more than 14 days outside of an organism, but I'm not sure if this applies to all viruses.  
",20930,"Since it seems unlikely that these data are available already from the novel virus, I'll refer to other coronavirus strains associated with outbreaks, the SARS-CoV coronavirus associated with an outbreak in 2003 and MERS-CoV.

In reference to the stability of the virus outside the body for SARS-CoV, the WHO consensus document said:


  Data from the Chinese University in Hong Kong indicated that SARS-CoV has
  been isolated from stool on paper, a Formica surface and a plastered wall after 36 hours, on a plastic surface and stainless steel after 72 hours, and after 96 hours on a glass slide.
  Hospital environmental samples from a number of sites, including walls and the ventilation
  system, tested PCR positive in Canada.


A later follow-up confirmed that SARS-CoV is viable possibly for days in the right conditions:


  In the present study, we have demonstrated that SARS CoV can survive at least two weeks after drying at temperature and humidity conditions found in an air-conditioned environment. The virus is stable for 3 weeks at room temperature in a liquid environment1

This suggests that SARS-CoV was better at surviving in the environment than other related strains, especially in cool temperatures. However, there was still a substantial decrease in viral titre by 1 week.

For MERS-CoV,


  MERS-CoV virus could still be recovered after 48 hours2


...on plastic and steel surfaces, though not at 72 hours, at 20C. The virus degraded more quickly at higher temperatures.

Assuming the new 2019-nCoV virus is similar to these, there is a risk of environmental transmission particularly in high-exposure locations like hospitals. It seems far less likely to be a risk after multiple weeks, but there is still little known about the new strain.

I was unable to find more than speculation about rates of actual infection due to exposure in these conditions, but that speculation is mostly focused on the health care setting and in particular on transmission in health care settings despite extensive precautions.

It's very difficult to connect culture viability to actual transmission risks, and not really ethical to swipe different concentrations of a coronavirus on the surfaces of a room and let people wander through to see how many get sick. Therefore, the best evidence for surface transmission of these viruses is when other methods of exposure can be mostly ruled out, and this is a very imperfect estimate.
",Reasonable,"If you get hungry very fast, you are most likely not eating enough for your activity level or not getting the right nutrient ratios.  Typically, if you up the protein and fiber content in your meals/snacks you'll be less hungry in general.

If you feel you are eating enough, check on whether or not your hunger is ""real"".  Sometimes things like not drinking enough water, too little sleep, etc. can trick you into thinking you are hungry, or, you may just wanting something to snack on out of boredom.  If this is the case, good snacks may be food that are lower calorie but high in volume, like:


Vegetables (and if you aren't a big fan, try adding some seasoning and roasting until crunchy)
Apple slices, banana, berries
Sunflower seeds (which take a while to eat shelled)

21135,Coronavirus conspiracy theory (HIV biological weapon),"There's a ridiculous conspiracy theory spreading that coronavirus is a genetically modified biological weapon gone rogue. According to one theory, the virus has traces of HIV and is designed to attack the immune system. My question isn't related to the evidence, which is non-existent, supporting this theory but rather the science behind the claim.

HIV can only spread via blood, semen, pre-seminal fluids, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk.

Yes, I know that you don't live in New York State. This is however the most useful and explanatory document that I have found on this matter and therefore linked it as further information.   

Mercury Levels Tests are performed either with urine or with blood in the New York State. 


  The most commonly accepted methods of assessing mercury exposure are
  to test urine or blood. Both tests usually measure levels of total
  mercury (elemental, inorganic and organic).     
  
  
  Elevated mercury in urine usually indicates exposure to an elemental or inorganic source
  of mercury, such as from a job that uses mercury. 
  Elevated mercury
  in blood usually indicates exposure to organic mercury (such as from
  eating fish containing methylmercury) or recent exposure to a high
  level of elemental mercury vapor. For most people, an elevated blood
  mercury level is associated with eating fish and other seafood
  containing organic mercury.     
  


(Source: New York Health Department)

In New York State, it is mandatory to report high level of mercury in blood or urine tests to the New York State Department of Health. Therefore, if anyone in New York had underwent a blood or urine test, they would have been notified if there are high mercury levels. (New York Health Department)

Massachusetts

It was a bit more challenging to find sources for Massachusetts. However, if one digs deep this is what I could find:

The Confidential Report Form for the State of Massachusetts states that all persons with mercury blood levels higher than 15 μg / L or urine mercury levels higher than 35 μg / g creatinine must be reported. (Link to the .doc version of the Confidential Report Form).
The Reporting Occupational Diseases and Injuries Form (again in .doc-type) states exactly the same.

The Public Health Fact Sheet Regarding Elemental Mercury Contamination at the Grafton Street School (MA) says that 


  [mercury] tests are available to measure elemental mercury levels in
  the body.
  Urine or blood samples are used to test for exposure to
  elemental mercury.  Urine is most useful for testing for potential
  inhalation exposure to elemental mercury.
  In order to get the most
  accurate measure of mercury, the sample should be collected soon after
  exposure.


Conclusion

Visit a GP of your choice and simply ask them to perform a mercury test on you. They will either collect blood or your urine and send it to a lab.     If they perform a urine test and you are very very sure that you only want organic mercury to be checked (where it is recommended to do a blood test), kindly tell them exactly this. 

I would strongly recommend printing out the linked PDF-Document and bringing that with you. It is easier for your doctor to accept the official document (and they will see that you are well-informed) than to trust in your reasoning.

There is what is referred to as a positive movie sign – that means
that refers to seating in a movie – fair amount of flexion – will get
achy in the ant/medial knee to the extent where you have to change
position or shake out the knee – patient may also have a feeling of the
knee catching or giving way.
Typically see mechanical causes of this pathology – will affect not
only tracking but also the contact surface areas of the PF jt




Etiology – Mechanical Causes


Genu Valgum (means knee) – where we are going to see an increase in the valgus vector at the knee- which is going to affect tracking.
Femoral Anteversion
Excessive Internal Femoral Rotation- alters the Q angle which
increases the lateral stresses.
Patella Alta – if the length of the patellar tendon exceeds the top
to bottom displacement of the patella by 15% or 1 cm
Laxity of medial capsular retinaculum
Tightness of the lateral retinaculum
Acute or chronic patellar subluxations
Pronation of the foot
External Tibial Torsion
Weakness of the VMO


This pathology – referred from the floor up – or from the hip down 


  Usually there is something going on above or below the joint – results
  in this pathology – must find what is causing this to be successful




Treatment


If you understand the cause you will be able to effectively plan the
intervention
There are things you can’t fix- structural deformities – if it
involves structures that displace the patella laterally
The follow will also alter patellar tracking.  Excessive pronation of the foot, weakness of VMO, tightness of lateral retinaculum  or ITB (ober , patellar tilt test) , weakness of frontal plane hip muscles




Misc Notes


Terminal Extension Exercises - Don’t strengthen the VMO
Open Kinetic Chain (OKC) – the literature says the OKC ex from a position of 90-45 degrees of flexion is the safe arc in terms of joint reaction forces to do open chain work
Close Kinetic Chain (CKC) - that arc of safe movement – is from 0-60 degrees of knee flexion 




What Professional(s) to See

An outpatient physical therapist should be able to narrow this down. As far as Musculoskeletal related issues the leading experts in this field are orthopedic surgeons (with physical therapists being #2).  

Professional Bias
However be aware just like a PT will advocate therapeutic exercise - a surgeon will tend to lean toward surgery.

Also see DoctorWhom's post below as he has provided some great insight that should help guide you what to do next.

21156,Why are people so worried about 2019-nCoV?,"EDIT: After reading the comments and learning more about the current outbreak, I see that the premise of my question is incorrect. I mistakenly believed that the virus' mortality rate was around the same as that of the flu, when in fact it's much higher.



My understanding is that the virus' mortality rate is around 2%, which is similar to the flu. It's less deadly than SARS.

So why are people so worried, and why are governments going to such extreme measures to prevent it from spreading? My guesses are:


We don't know enough about the long-term effects of the virus, so better safe than sorry
The economic and social disruption caused by robust measures (e.g., quarantining) costs less than letting a new disease become pandemic, even if it isn't particularly deadly
Mass hysteria fueled by the media and misinformation
Governments feeling like they have to appear responsive to popular concern lest they seem lazy
This virus affects more developed parts of the world, so it's more visible
The Chinese government's over-the-top, authoritarian, ""only in China""-style measures have left everyone in such awe that they think, ""this must be really serious!"" (When in fact the government's real intention is perhaps to cover up how badly they botched their initial handling of the outbreak.)


As for one's chances of coming into contact with the virus, the total number of confirmed cases in the world as of writing is around 80k. Let's say that the true number is double that, or 160,000. That's still only ~1.5% of the population of Wuhan, the city where the initial outbreak occurred. Why should anyone be in the slightest bit concerned about going for a stroll down the main street?

I'm not an expert in public health or medicine. It would be great to hear an expert's take on this question!
",21205,"The danger posed to society from this disease doesn't come from the mortality rate, rather from the potential to make large fraction of the population ill. Unlike the flu virus, this virus is a new virus to which we have no immunity.

About 10% of the infected people requires hospital treatment, which is a lot higher than in case of flu. The death rate of the order of 1% is achieved thanks to excellent hospital treatment. With a far larger fraction of the population infected with this virus compared to the flu and a far larger fraction of the infected people requiring hospital treatment compared to flu, the available hospital capacity to give everyone the treatment they need can be easily exhausted. The death rate due to the virus will then increase.

Also, people who need treatment for other reasons can then also fail to get prompt medical attention. People suffering a heart attack who would have survived under normal circumstances thanks to getting prompt medical attention, may now end up dying too. 
",Reasonable,"Iodine is absolutely an essential mineral, and is required for proper functioning of your body. It is a component of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (also known as T3) and its precursor form T4 (thyroxine). This hormone is involved in quite a few processes in the body, and acts on nearly every cell in it. 

A deficit of iodine can cause a number of diseases, including goiter (swelling of the thyroid gland in the neck), hypothyroidism (can cause increased sensitivity to cold, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and depression), gastric cancer, and cretinism (presents as severely stunted development and growth, both physical and mental, but unlikely to affect a healthy adult).

Now, iodized salt is not the only source of iodine in one's food. It can also be found in fish, shellfish, and kelp products, milk and eggs from iodine-sufficient farm animals, and plants grown on iodine-rish soil. The recommended intake of iodine varies between 150 &micro;g per day for healthy adults to 250-290 &micro;g/day for pregnant and lactating women, respectively. Children require somewhat lower amounts. On the other hand, the recommended upper limit is around 1100 &micro;g (1.1 mg) per day for adults. 

A quarter teaspoon (1.5g) of the iodized sea salt in my cabinet provides ""45%"" of the recommended daily value of iodine (the label doesn't provide mass). Assuming they're using the 150 &micro;g value, that's 67.5 &micro;g iodine in a serving that provides one quarter of your sodium for the day. The table in this section of the Health Professional Fact Sheet for iodine from the NIH's Office of Dietary Supplements provides some values for iodine levels in various other food sources:



So, bottom line, you are likely getting sufficient iodine in your daily diet, even without using iodized salt. Now, I don't want to discourage the use of it at all, as there is absolutely nothing wrong with it from a health perspective (except from overconsumption, but that applies to most everything). Not everyone (especially in America, the UK, and some other countries) eat very healthy diets, but since the use of iodized salt in restaurants and for food manufacturers is required by law, Westerners are not likely to be under-iodinated.

Of course, the best way to tell is to go to your primary health care provider, explain your situation, and ask if they'd be willing to order a thyroid function blood test. It looks at the levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, from the pituitary gland) along with thyroid hormone itself. However, as long as you aren't experiencing any of the symptoms of hypothyroidism and don't have a goiter, you're probably OK.

21201,Who came up with the SARS-CoV-2 name?,"I know that the WHO came up with the COVID-19 name, but I see big publisher (Springer) also using ""SARS-CoV-2"" seemingly to refer to the same thing. To be more technically correct, they say the  latter refers to the virus, rather than the disease:


  SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus responsible for an outbreak of respiratory illness known as COVID-19.


Anyway, who came up with the ""SARS-CoV-2"" name?
",21202,"Although the latter term is less publicized in the mass media, a WHO page basically calls it official too, although it was the ICTV that came up with it:


  Viruses are named based on their genetic structure to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines. Virologists and the wider scientific community do this work, so viruses are named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).
  
  Diseases are named to enable discussion on disease prevention, spread, transmissibility, severity and treatment. Human disease preparedness and response is WHO’s role, so diseases are officially named by WHO in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
  
  ICTV announced “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)” as the name of the new virus on 11 February 2020.  This name was chosen because the virus is genetically related to the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003.  While related, the two viruses are different.   
  
  WHO announced “COVID-19” as the name of this new disease on 11 February 2020, following guidelines previously developed with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
  
  WHO and ICTV were in communication about the naming of both the virus and the disease.


So yeah, the two names originate from different organizations (as far as I can tell the ICTV is not subordinated to the WHO in any way), but they apparently held some talks on the matter. Nonetheless, the WHO does seem a little displeased with including ""SARS"" in the virus name...


  From a risk communications perspective, using the name SARS can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations, especially in Asia which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003. 
  
  For that reason and others, WHO has begun referring to the virus as “the virus responsible for COVID-19” or “the COVID-19 virus” when communicating with the public.  Neither of these designations are intended as replacements for the official name of the virus as agreed by the ICTV.


Likewise, some virologists were displeased with the WHO name. In the later published SARS-CoV-2 (naming) paper of ICTV's CSG (Coronaviridae Study Group) they do ""mend fences"" however, saying that:


  By uncoupling the naming conventions used for coronaviruses and the diseases that some of them cause in humans and animals, we wish to support the WHO in its efforts to establish disease names in the most appropriate way. [...] The further advancement of naming conventions is also important because the ongoing discovery of new human and animal viruses by next-generation sequencing technologies can be expected to produce an increasing number of viruses that do not (easily) fit the virus–disease model that was widely used in the pre-genomic era [...]. Having now established different names for the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease (COVID-19), the CSG hopes that this will raise awareness in both the general public and public health authorities regarding the difference between these two entities. The CSG promotes this clear distinction because it will help improve the outbreak management and also reduces the risk of confusing virus and disease, as has been the case over many years with SARS-CoV (the virus) and SARS (the disease).

",Reasonable,"There is a good article on that in Nature, where in a study it was found that non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) in fact do lead to a rise of serum insuline levels, possibly via a induced change of the gut flora, proven by the fact that the effect could be reproduced after fecal transplantation in mice. (Full article here)

And this is about the status of scientific knowledge about it. There is a good review on the NAS topic in childrens' diets.

Also, Aspartame exposure during pregnancy has been found to reduce insulin sensitivity in male mice, thereby showing a gender difference and other side effects.

So, to answer the question: By today's knowledge it's yes, they may cause insulin spikes, but rather indirectly. But nonetheless, they produce measurable adverse effects on your glucose homeostasis, the pathways of which are still not quite clear but may - amongst others - have to do with your gut flora, your insulin receptor sensitivity or behaviourial mechanisms of the brain reacting to sweet taste.

",21269,"There are two general categories of tests typically used for identifying viral infections: those based on viral genetic material and those based on host immune response.

The CDC page on MERS-CoV testing (also a coronavirus, just not the one that causes COVID-19) is an informative resource to start with (bold added and reformatted by me):


  Molecular tests are used to diagnose active infection (presence of MERS-CoV) in people who are thought to be infected with MERS-CoV based on their clinical symptoms and having links to places where MERS has been reported.
  
  Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays are molecular tests that can be used to detect viral RNA in clinical samples.
  
  Serology testing is used to detect previous infection (antibodies to MERS-CoV) in people who may have been exposed to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system to attack and kill viruses, bacteria, and other microbes during infection. The presence of antibodies to MERS-CoV indicates that a person had been previously infected with the virus and developed an immune response.


For some diseases, the primary type of test used is measuring immune reactivity; tuberculosis comes to mind.

However, tests currently being used for 2019-nCoV are of the ""molecular"" type: RT-PCR assays detecting viral RNA. Viral RNA is only present during an active infection. These tests can be used both when a patient is showing symptoms, to identify the infection, and also to retest later to show that the infection has been cleared.
",Reasonable,"There is no data to suggest that is the case.

",21278,"Most of the COVID-19 deaths in Washington involve a single nursing home, where the virus spread widely before being detected.

The patients at that facility are in a high-risk category for this disease due to their advanced age; there is no similar cluster of cases at a nursing facility elsewhere in the US, therefore it is not surprising that the mortality rate is quite different so far.

There is speculation that there are far more undiagnosed cases in Washington, many of which would be mild cases. Given issues and limitations with testing, it is difficult to know what the true rate is.
",Reasonable,"Even if you get the results of several tests on one paper, every single test is a separate test. For example, electrolyte panel can contain results for sodium, potassium, chlorine and bicarbonate tests, but you don't need to use the word ""test"" when describing the results.

When describing the results of actual tests in practice, you can use levels, which can be either high (or elevated) or low (or decreased). You can use levels for minerals (sodium, potassium, iron, magnesium), vitamins, blood cells (leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes...), glucose, cholesterol, liver enzymes, etc. For example:


My blood potassium level was high.
My fasting blood glucose was high. (You can skip the word ""level"" and also the ""test."") 
My HDL cholesterol was low.
My neutrophils were slightly increased.


Immunological/allergic tests can be positive or negative.


My skin prick test result for wheat was positive.
My test for antinuclear antibodies was negative.


So, there are several possibilities how to mention or not mention the ""test"" or ""result"" or ""level."" You can skip them all if the meaning is clear from the context.

I haven't heard or read that any doctor or health article writer would use ""marker"" for any test result presented to a patient. Authors usually use the term when discussing new tests in development or comparing new and old type of tests to say, which test result more reliably show the underlying pathology. For example:

The basic mechanism is clear, and the magnitude is plausible: Let n be the average number of persons infected by one infected person. If n falls below 1, then the epidemy will run out. This will happen if an infected person mostly hits persons who are already immune.

The question is: Why just 60-70%, not 40-50 or 80-90%? Does it come from historic precedence? Or from some formula that takes into account the value of n (the value before saturation has set in)? What citation classics could serve as reference?
",21307,"Some Canadian experts said 35% to 70% will be infected:


  According to a disease-transmission model developed by University of
  Toronto researchers, the virus’ overall attack rate in Canada could
  exceed 70 per cent. That number drops sharply, by about half, “if we
  add modest control,” said epidemiologist Dr. David Fisman, one of the
  model’s creators, but it will take “aggressive social distancing and
  large scale quarantines” to reduce it further, he said.
  
  “That’s still a huge number of people ill, and critically ill people
  are a large fraction in this disease,” Fisman said in an email. “I’m
  not going to share more specific numbers because I think they will
  scare people to no particular end.”


In reality no one knows. I can tell you if they contain the spread no more people will be infected. If they don't contain the spread more people will be infected. Steps like Italy took today where only essential work can occur and all business closed except transportation, grocery stores and pharmacies are a desperate attempt at containment that may be too late. That said given recent numbers it appears to have worked for China.

The German Chancellor is wasting her time and ours spewing off meaningless numbers that will only serve to scare citizens of the nation she is supposed to lead. Something better would be her plan to make the homeless self-isolate for 14 days at home if they come into contact with someone who was positive or preemptively positive.

Typically an influenza outbreak of any kind results in nursing homes and other sensitive areas being closed to visitors and their taking extra precautions for internal cleanliness and hygiene.

If all the effort were put into protecting the most vulnerable and everyone else simply warned to be careful, the disease would spread among the general population but there would be very few serious cases.

",21321,"I think the following quoted article mostly answers my question.

The current, sometimes draconian, measures are not being taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19, only to reduce the rate at which it spreads.

A system that can handle a hundred new patients each week for many months, typically can't handle hundreds of new patients each day for a few weeks.

In either case, the same number of people get infected.

In one case the seriously ill can be properly treated, in the other case almost no one can be properly treated.

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) - Our World in Data contains this information:


  ‘Flattening the curve’
  
  This is why early counter measures are important in an epidemic. Their
  intention is to lower the rate of infection so that the epidemic is
  spread out over time and the peak demand for the health care system is
  lower.
  
  While the total number who get infected might not change, the
  containment measures intend to avoid an outbreak trajectory in which a
  large number of people get sick at the same time. This is what the
  visualization shows.
  
  This is the reason that limiting the magnitude of peak incidence of an
  outbreak is important – health systems can care for more patients when
  the number of cases is spread out over a long period and it is not
  peaking in a very short period.
  
  A worst-case scenario for a pandemic of COVID-19 is that the number of
  patients at one point in time is so large that health systems would
  fail to provide the required care for some of them



",Reasonable,"This answer includes some speculation in the end. Since this is also a speculative question I hope that's okay :-)


  if people who suffer from paralysis, specifically those who can't walk anymore, lose strength in their skeletal structure from the waist down as well.


Yes. Bones that aren't used lose mass. In a study of 89 men who had been in a wheelchair for at least 2 months and up to 50 years:


  In the femur and tibia, bone mass, total and trabecular bone mineral density (BMDtot and BMDtrab, respectively) of the epiphyses, as well as bone mass and cortical cross-sectional area of the diaphyses, showed an exponential decrease with time after injury in the spinal cord injured subjects. The decreasing bone parameters reached new steady states after 3–8 years, depending on the parameter. Bone mass loss in the epiphyses was approximately 50% in the femur and 60% in the tibia, while the shafts lost only approximately 35% in the femur and 25% in the tibia. 


Relationship between the duration of paralysis and bone structure: a pQCT study of spinal cord injured individuals

Other studies agree:


  In the lower extremities the BMC decreased after injury. New steady-state levels for BMC were reached at 2 years post-injury for the proximal tibia and the femoral neck at 40–50% and 60–70% respectively of normal values


Longitudinal study of bone mineral content in the lumbar spine, the forearm and the lower extremities after spinal cord injury.


  if there would be an advancement that would allow them to move their bones with the aid of artificial muscles, would their bones be rigid enough to still support them? If not, would there be a type of therapy combined with supplements that would help them regain strength in their bones?


There are ""standing wheelchairs"", designed to give patients with paralysis the chance to stand up, which helps with household activities, etc. 

The Rehabilitation Engineering &amp; Assistive Technology Society of North America released a position paper on these devices. They cite numerous health benefits, among them benefit for bone mineral density :


  Research suggests that weight bearing is superior to nutritional supplements in preventing BMD loss, and that the mechanical loading of the bones should be dynamic for full prevention of BMD loss. It also appears that with discontinuation of the weight bearing program, BMD levels will continue to decrease and/or return to pre-weight bearing values.


They cite a few studies for this benefit, among them:


Static vs dynamic loads as an influence on bone remodelling
Low magnitude mechanical loading is osteogenic in children with disabling conditions


However, other research does not agree with this, saying that after the first year after the injury has passed, bone mineral density does not recover even from weight-bearing exercises. From Non-pharmacological treatment and prevention of bone loss after spinal cord injury: a systematic review:


  For the chronic phase (Table 2), the picture seems more uniform, with very little evidence for any gain in BMD when the first year after injury has passed. 


They also looked at studies regarding other intervention, for example electrical stimulation and found no significant benefits:


  The level of evidence is important and in this study area, there is no conclusive indication of any effective intervention.


However, that doesn't mean your scenario would not work:


This is talking about losing bone mineral density compared to control groups. However, from standing assisting technology we know that the remaining bone density is enough to at least support short-term standing, bearing a significant part of the individual's body weight. A return to pre-paralysis levels might not be needed for short-term walking, for example. 
The construction of such a device would lead to more studies into this. Right now, stopping the loss of bone density is not the primary motivating factor for the use of standing wheelchairs, for example - they are to increase quality of life and also to strengthen the individual's circulation, for example.

21318,Why are people with COVID-19 symptoms being denied tests in the US?,"I have heard several times now, from both people I personally know and from others who have posted their stories online that they do not qualify for COVID-19 testing.

From the stories I have heard, to qualify you have to:
1. Had contact with a known case of COVID-19
2. Been to a country heavily infected with COVID-19
3. Have symptoms that have progressed to the point where hospitalization is required

We now have a reported 1339 cases in the US with likely many more undiagnosed by medical professionals or the CDC.

Why, when we are in a state of pandemic and all countries scrambling to get a handle on the virus, are clinics, primary cares, and even hospitals not administering tests to those who exhibit symptoms unless one of these other criteria are met?

With an incubation period of 2-14 days, it is entirely possible to have contact with someone who has it and not know you got it from them.
",21399,"There's yet another reason: a test can provide only a certain amount of information gain. If the probability to have contracted Covid-19 before the test is too low, even though we know more after the test we may not be able to draw  practical conclusions that are any different from the recommendations without test. In other words, if the recommendation goes from ""stay at home and avoid contact to others"" to ""stay at home and avoid contact to others"" the test would be wasted.

The Covid-19 tests are not suitable for screening purposes (i.e. searching for infections among a population where infections are [still] very rare). They are to sort out who is infected and who isn't among high-risk populations where 1 in 10 (or more) are actually infected. 



You may want to look at my longish answer to How accurate are coronavirus tests? for relevant background.



E.g., with the newly emergency approved Roche test, we may say that a positive test result increases the odds of having Covid-19 by factor of somewhere around 30 - 100, a negative result decreases the odds by a factor of 1/50 - 1/17. 

If you are in a risk group with a prevalence of 8 %, the pre-test odds of 8 : 92 


increase to (240 to 800) : 92 or a post-test probability of having Covid-19 of 70 to 90 % with a positive test result, and
decrease to 8 : (4600 to 1564), i.e. the post-test probability of having Covid-19 is somewhere around 0.5 to 0.2 %


These post-test probabilities allow practical conclusions: if you're negative, you're fine and can be let to meet the public, if you're positive you need to go to quarantine and/or treatment.  

8 % prevalence is my guesstimate for those who are currently (Mar 15th) tested in the US (and incidentally, also in Germany).

Now consider the overall US population. With currently 1629 cases and a population of 328 mio., we'd get pre-test odds of 1629 : 328 mio*. 

The test results change this to 


positive result: (27700 to 162900) : 328 mio or a post-test probability of having Covid-19 of 0.008 to 0.005 %
negative result: we don't even need to calculate this, because the pre-test probability was only 0.0005 %, post-test probability is lower.


Even if we assume that there's a dark number of yet unknown Covid-19 cases, say, a factor 20 over the known cases, the post-test probabiliy after a positive test is about 0.2 % to 1%. 

What would be the practical conclusion? Well, probably that the positive case should stay at home as much as possible  and avoid contacts. Certainly not that they can rely on acquiring immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

Even for low risk groups who have flu-like symptoms but no known contact to Covid infected people (or other high-risk situations) the pre-test probability of having Covid is too low to allow the test to make a meaningful difference: after all, even if it is ""only a common flu"", they should stay at home, get well and not infect others meanwhile. 
While the pre-test probability is likely to increase (because more people get infected), in order to keep the health system/hospitals working the recommendation will probably not change: stay at home in self-quarantine as long as the symptoms are mild, so that the health system is not burdened by cases that get well on their own.

We may also say that were the whole US population to be tested in that situation, the 32500 true cases of Covid would be drowned in 3 - 10 mio. false positve cases.

The disease has so far only been recorded in 9 of the 54 African countries, with only three of these countries reporting more than a couple of cases.

Given the wider spread of the disease in practically every other region, and that the African population is around 1.3 billion, this appears to be a clear anomaly.

Look at the two diagrams.  The temporal artery is a branch of the external carotid artery that stays outside the skull.  The internal carotid artery goes inside the skull.  



You couldn't compress the skull with sunglasses if you tried.

 

MANY headaches are related to muscular/tendinous pain in the head and neck, not the brain. Putting pressure on the temporal regions can cause pain in the muscles, and sustained pressure can cause spasms.  Restricting the flow through the arteries of your face could in theory reduce flow to muscles of your scalp, causing pain and ischemia.  It is less likely to be the cause of pain from sunglasses pressure, as there is lots of collateral blood flow, but not impossible.

Note that transmitting any force through the actual skull via compression, which is a pretty solid bone, would take a great deal of pressure (orders of magnitude above what sunglasses are capable of) and would involve fracturing bone. Then you'd be looking at potential stroke/TBI symptoms.  That is not happening to you.

I am not going to discuss your symptoms of confusion, that starts down the path of individual medical advice.  If you are concerned about any of your symptoms, see a doctor.

",21422,"The viruses are acting differently.  Sars2-ncov-19 virus is much more infectious with a much higher viral replication rate, and with people exhaling the virus in the pre-symptomatic phase whereas SARS this was not happening.  Once the infected individual becomes symptomatic their bodies are producing antibodies which helps shut down viral particle shedding though virus is still being transmitted by cough which aerolizes the virus at a further distance then just by exhalation.


  The nine patients, who were admitted to the same Munich hospital, were studied because they had had close contact with an index case. Cell cultures and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were done on throat swabs and samples of sputum, stool, blood, and urine. Throat swabs showed very high viral shedding during the first week of symptoms.

So this is all AFAIK, and I'm happy be corrected - and OP please take this with the appropriate caution against stuff written in the internet by random strangers.


The tests are developed in much haste, and undergo some emergency validation rather than the full validation procedure that is usually required. This naturally leads to some uncertainty about their performance, but we accept that in order to have tests available at all right now.
See e.g. what the FDA says about Covid tests

Different tests search for different parts of the virus RNA.
(This is getting very far from my field, but is this the information you're looking for as what exctly is tested [by the CDC-developed test]?)
Viruses mutate, so a test that works well at some place at one time may not work as well somewhere else or a few weeks or months later. 
For a test to work, 


sampling 
possibly transport
extraction from the sample (difficulty varies e.g. between mouth swabs and sputum)
the test kit  


must all work well. E.g. if the sampling is not done properly because there's no properly trained staff available, nothing can be done further down the analytic process. I don't know why the Indonesian tests don't work, but it may be as ""simple"" as samples undergoing long transportation to a lab with the appropriate equipment so they spoil on the way.
The faulty tests in the US seem to have had a wrong reagent - and burocratic approval was needed for the labs to replace that by their own good reagents.
(Usually, if a lab wants to use other than the prescribed/delivered reagent, they need to a lengthy validation of the procedure - the point here is to be allowed to avoid that as it would take too long)

  The mask, which touches the patient’s face, should be cleaned daily with distilled water. Rinsing the face mask or tubing with tap water, instead of using distilled water, or adding tap water in the humidifier is a potential source of legionella colonization.


Sterile distilled water cannot sustain legionella growth (Joly, et al. 1986). Therefore I would not hold much credibility to the idea that you don't need to throw the remaining water out in the morning. Fresh water is to be used each night. Adding tap water in the humidifier is a potential source of legionella colonization (Schnirman, et al. 2017)


  Most recommend that the tubing and humidifier be cleaned at least weekly. Some suppliers also recommend cleaning the mask and tubing with vinegar and water daily. In addition, masks and tubing are designed to be disposable; they should not be used more than their recommended periods, which is generally 3–6 months for CPAP masks. (Schnirman, et al. 2017)

  Was the test evaluated by the FDA?



The clinical evaluation needs to be done by the manufacturer, not by the FDA. The FDA then evaluates the results submitted by the manufacturer with ther EUA application. 
The test is not on the FDA page that lists approved tests.
We don't know why. E.g., whether they it did not pass the FDA EUA requirements (I'd think that unlikely) or the manufacturer never applied (which may be totally sensible for several reasons, e.g. if their manufacturing capactity is such that all the tests they produce are bought, say, in East Asia)



  What rigors did FDA approval of the Roche COVID test meet? 



see the FDA FAQ on getting EUA and requirements for using a test even before that EUA is in place on the general requirements and 
the Roche test Manufacturer's instructions listing their validation results in particular.
FDA explicitly says that they want the manufacturer to be in early contact with them. 




A few more thoughts:


It is not only the test kit that needs approval, the test kit gets approved for use with certain extraction equipment (manufacturer &amp; possibly model) and also the lab needs certain approval.
It may be that in East Asia different machines (other manufacturers) are used, so that the South Korean approval cannot be used for evaluating performance with the machinery predominantly used by US labs.
The first EUA for the CDC Covid test was granted by the FDA on Feb. 4th. I.e., one day before Seegene had their first test kit according to the CNN post and thus more than a week before the Seegene test got South Korean fast-track approval.  
That such a test with fast track validation may turn out not to be that great after all is a known risk which is accepted in the current situation in order to have tests available at all. We still would not expect faulty reagents in the test kit, though.   
Theres nothing that unique about the South Korean  test manufacturer. There are other manufacturers and also ones that were apparently even earlier (sent out first [unapproved] tests on Jan 10th) than the South Koreans, see e.g. this new post about a Berlin manufacturer of such tests (in German). This news post reads very similar to the South Korean, just with a different company.
We also don't know yet how long/where which test will perform well as mutations of the virus will happen - and they may affect the performance of some tests but possibly not others. The Berlin test manufacturer discusses this in another newspaper article/interview.
AFAIK, other test kits also don't require manual PCR - whether in some countries the testing is done manually because the local approved labs don't have automated extraction/PCR machinery in place is a totally different question.

  ""the molecule looks really good; it's really well behaved; the
  structure kind of demonstrates that the molecule is stable in the
  correct confirmation that we were hoping for,"" McLellan said. ""So now
  we and others will use the molecule that we created as a basis for
  vaccine antigen.""


Also saying:


  In theory, the spike protein itself ""could be either the vaccine or
  variants of a vaccine,"" McLellan said. When you inject this
  spike-protein-based vaccine, ""humans would make antibodies against the
  spike, and then if they were ever exposed to the live virus,""


The article goes on to say:


  Their colleagues at the NIH will now inject these spike proteins into
  animals to see how well the proteins trigger antibody production.
  Still, McLellan thinks a vaccine is likely about 18 to 24 months away.
  That's ""still quite fast compared to normal vaccine development, which
  might take like 10 years,"" he said.


My question is: Why not inject, or drink, these spike proteins for immunity to Covid-19? Why expect an 18-24 month wait? The anti-body production response should occur(and be detectable) in days?
",21532,"Vaccines need extensive testing before they can be used. There's essentially no medical intervention which requires more testing than vaccines, which are used in extremely large numbers of healthy patients.

Generally this involves basic research, animal testing, Phase I testing (""Is it safe in humans? At what dose?""), Phase II testing (""Is it effective? At what dose? Are there side effects?""), and Phase III testing (""Is it safe and effective across all different subpopulations?"").

As just one example of what could potentially go wrong: many/most COVID-19 deaths involve cytokine storms which are, roughly, damaging inflammatory immune overreactions. Priming the immune system could potentially worsen them and increase deaths by strengthening the immune response. (It doesn't seem likely, but this is why we test.)

  does that mean every one in the world at some point has to get infected until a vaccine is invented?


No. There are many infectous diseases which are only regional, or have been almost eradicated. Countries free of (this or that) disease need to act quickly on imported cases, if the disease is highly infectuous. 

On the other hand, if the spread of a pathogen in a (say closed) region is slowed down substantially, people who have developed immunity in this region will generally make the reproductive factor of the epidemic lower - and thus make it easier to contain its spread.

21571,ACE2 Inhibition as therapeutic candidate?,"Disclaimer: I am a scientist, but this is not my main field so sorry if I've not used the correct terminology at this busy time...

Since the coronavirus protein bonds with and gains entry to the cell by bonding to ACE2 receptor, does anyone happen to be currently working upon inhibition of the ACE2 receptor?

Obviously it's not straight forward just to use an inhibitor of some sort without accounting for side effects, but is this form of therapy a potentially practical avenue?

I anticipate that this relationship with ACE2 is why we get pneumonia with COVID19 since ACE2 is abundant in the lungs, heart and kidneys... And that perhaps it's why people with cardiovascular disease and problems have the highest mortality?

From my understanding, there would be potential cardiac and renal issues. Possibly the negative effects of inhibitors may be reduced or managed by IV infusion of angiotensin 1-7, or supporting drugs (I.e. a vasodilator) as ACE2 won't be able to work on converting angiotensin 2?

To anyone whom is working in this area specifically, what I am really asking is, is this a viable avenue to consider, as a management strategy to reduce spread of the virus in-vivo?

The infection route and effects make me wonder how many people that recover from COVID19 may unfortunately suffer later cardiological or renal issues due to damage in ACE2 expression within the lungs... And not just lung damage from the virus or resulting pneumonia. (I.e fibrosis of cardiac tissues, etc)

I've found this: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijpep/2012/256294/ 
Which seems to suggest that it has been studied to an extent in animals, but find limited information.

*** Note I'm talking about ACE2 inhibition not ACE inhibitors that are often used in heart failure
",21658,"The problem appears to be that the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptor and carries the receptor into the cell where the RNA of the virus is then released. Because the cell now lacks ACE2 surface receptors this leads to intracellular damage due to lack of inhibition of AT1-R in the Renin Angiotensin System.  

The cells that are damaged in the lung are deep alveolar cells that make surfactant and this collapses the alveoli causing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. interestingly lung infiltrates are seen early in the disease hence the use in China of CT chest scans for screening before rapid PCR became available. ACE2 are also found widely throughout the heart and gut the latter where it assists enzymes that are transporting amino acids.  The ACE2 receptor bearing cells are found in cardiac tissue, lung, gut, macrophages etc and the main clinical effect of their loss of function is to cause cardiopulmonary damage.

if you were to create a drug that targeted the ACE2 receptor then you would be replicating the deleterious effect of the virus which inter alia blocks the protective effect of ACE2 on pulmonary and renal damage.

There's been some experimental work showing that a fully humanised soluble ACE2 receptor can bind to the virus and blocks entry into the ACE2 bearing cells. It works like a neutralising antibody to the virus. 

This treatment is currently awaiting Chinese FDA approval for clinical trials.

21623,What percentage of otherwise asymptomatic covid-19 cases are presenting just with anosmia?,"
  Post-viral anosmia is one of the leading causes of loss of sense of smell in adults, accounting for up to 40% cases of anosmia. Viruses that give rise to the common cold are well known to cause post-infectious loss, and over 200 different viruses are known to cause upper respiratory tract infections. Previously described coronaviruses are thought to account for 10-15% cases. It is therefore perhaps no surprise that the novel COVID-19 virus would also cause anosmia in infected patients.


But people are reporting anosmia as a presenting symptom.  What are the percentages here?
",21624,"This situation has not been fully characterised yet and has not been reported in the cases as a significant presentation before.  But ENT UK has issued the following advisory and hopes to stall the inappropriate use of steroids for anosmia


  There is already good evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that significant numbers of patients with proven COVID-19 infection have developed anosmia/hyposmia. In Germany it is reported that more than 2 in 3 confirmed cases have anosmia. In South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases. 
  
  In addition, there have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms – this has been widely shared on medical discussion boards by surgeons from all regions managing a high incidence of cases. Iran has reported a sudden increase in cases of isolated anosmia, and many colleagues from the US, France and Northern Italy have the same experience. I have personally seen four patients this week, all under 40, and otherwise asymptomatic except for the recent onset of anosmia – I usually see roughly no more than one a month. I think these patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately, these patients do not meet current criteria for testing or self-isolation.
  
  While there is a chance the apparent increase in incidence could merely reflect the attention COVID-19 has attracted in the media, and that such cases may be caused by typical rhinovirus and coronavirus strains, it could potentially be used as a screening tool to help identify otherwise asymptomatic patients, who could then be better instructed on self-isolation.
  
  Given the potential for COVID-19 to present with anosmia, and the reports that corticosteroid use may increase the severity of infection, we would advise against use of oral steroids in the treatment of new onset anosmia during the pandemic, particularly if it is unrelated to head trauma or nasal pathology (such as nasal polyps).
  
  There is potential that if any adult with anosmia but no other symptoms was asked to self-isolate for seven days, in addition to the current symptom criteria used to trigger quarantine, we might be able to reduce the number of otherwise asymptomatic individuals who continue to act as vectors, not realising the need to self-isolate. It will also be an important trigger for healthcare personnel to employ full PPE and help to counter the higher rates of infection found amongst ENT surgeons compared to other healthcare workers.

",Reasonable,"Yes, there is evidence that alkaline food affects internal pH, but it is important to note that the regulation of internal pH (acid-base homeostatis) has other contributing factors, which is why the impact of food is subtle.

I'm mainly aware of evidence from studies on sodium bicarbonate, as an example for a simple way to supplement alkaline food.


Gabriela Froio de Araujo Dias et al: (In)Consistencies in Responses to Sodium Bicarbonate Supplementation: A Randomised, Repeated Measures, Counterbalanced and Double-Blind Study

This experiment studies the effect of sodium bicarbonate as a pre-workout supplement. Blood pH is measured at baseline, pre-workout (after either placebo or sodium bicarbonate supplementation), and post-workout.



Dashed lines are the placebo group, solid lines the sodium bicarbonate group. This shows that the buffering from sodium bicarbonate has a slight effect on blood pH even pre-workout.
Jessica Danaher et al: The effect of β-alanine and NaHCO3 co-ingestion on buffering capacity and exercise performance with high-intensity exercise in healthy males

This study has a different focus, but the experimental setup and results in terms of blood pH response are similar (labels ""SB"" are sodium bicarbonate groups; RSA and CCT refer to two different exercises):




So technically you could say that alkaline food ""helps to regulate internal pH"", but it is a very weak influence. To emphasize the impact of other contributing factors to blood pH, it is also interesting to look at something like this:


M. Kox et al: Voluntary Activation of The Sympathetic Nervous System and Attenuation of the Innate Immune Response In Humans

This article studies the effect of the Wim Hof method, in particular its breathing technique. The breathing technique basically alternates between voluntary hyperventilation and breath holds. The supplementary material features a video of one subject performing the breathing technique, including monitoring of blood pH over the course of the exercise. The subject has a basline blood pH of 7.4. During hyperventilation, blood pH increases over 7.6 as a result of the reduced carbon dioxide levels in the blood. During breath retention, carbon dioxide levels normalize and the blood pH falls (almost) back to the baseline level. Note that these effects on pH are very quick compared to nutritional influences.


This example shows why it is difficult to separate the effect from alkaline food from other factors contributing to pH homeostasis. Taking a few deep breaths or holding your breath has a very immediate effect on blood pH, which can easily bias the more subtle effect from an alkaline diet. I'm not an expert, but I could imagine that the respiratory rate is even determined by dietary factors. Thus, instead of studying the effect on internal pH, it might be more sensible to show that an alkaline diet leads to reduced breathing in the long term, because the body could maintain the same pH level even with higher carbon dioxide levels.

  Bed bugs are not known to spread disease. Bed bugs can be an annoyance because their presence may cause itching and loss of sleep. Sometimes the itching can lead to excessive scratching that can sometimes increase the chance of a secondary skin infection.


and 


  A common concern with bed bugs is whether or not they transmit diseases. Although bed bugs can harbor various pathogens, transmission to humans has not been proven and is considered unlikely.


However, blood also contains some macrophages which have been shown to possess ACE2 receptors which could lead to the macrophages getting infected though surface expression is low.  One would have to posit that the virus enters the bug's gut but somehow leaves again, and somehow reaches the bugs' beak while being unable to replicate.  

To further put this into perspective a cc of blood has usually less than 15,000 white cells. The volume of blood suckled by a bed bug is a way lot less, and macrophages are further sparse in white cells at 5%.

",Reasonable,"Yes. This is an interesting question. 

I can think of two examples, one which I think is closer to what you're thinking about, and another being related conceptually. 

1. Prodromal phase of schizophrenia


  then surely it should reason that there are people who experience delusions that are the opposite of distress i.e pleasure 


What you're describing, if it does occur, generally happens during the prodromal phase of schizophrenia, which is a period of one or two years prior to the first episode of florid psychosis. This is thought to be related to the hyperdopaminergic state that characterises the positive symptoms of schizophrenia e.g. hallucinations, delusions.

Although the lay view of dopamine's role is one relating to pleasure, it's generally thought to be related to incentive salience. The prodrome may describe the whole world as ""lighting up"" or ""finally making sense"". Oftentimes there can be metaphysical undertones.

From The Phenomenological Critique and Self-disturbance: Implications for Ultra-High Risk (“Prodrome”) Research:


  A common finding in studies of the prodromal period has been of a
  developing preoccupation with philosophical, supernatural, and
  metaphysical themes. The rupture in “normal” self-experience
  motivates such a preoccupation; in cognitive terms, the patient is
  attempting to accommodate his anomalous experience to existing
  schemas. Feelings of centrality or solipsism may come to the fore.


And from Phenomenology of anomalous self-experience in early schizophrenia:



A classic is Knots (1970) by R.D. Laing who was both a psychiatrist and someone who experienced psychosis. I recommend getting a hold of it. It's very short and will make no sense. But it also will, and that's the entire point:



2. Mystical experience

Psychosis and mystical experience are two antipodal human experiences but they both have something in common: they are both departures from our everyday experience of reality. 

The following is from William James' The Varieties Of Religious Experience (1901) which is considered a classic:


  Open any one of these, and you will find abundant cases in which
  ‘mystical ideas’ are cited as characteristic symptoms of enfeebled or
  deluded states of mind. In delusional insanity, paranoia, as they
  sometimes call it, we may have a diabolical mysticism, a sort of
  religious mysticism turned upside down. The same sense of ineffable
  importance in the smallest events, the same texts and words coming
  with new meanings, the same voices and visions and leadings and
  missions, the same controlling by extraneous powers; only this time
  the emotion is pessimistic: instead of consolations we have
  desolations; the meanings are dreadful; and the powers are enemies to
  life.


The point I am making here is that the ""pleasurable form of psychosis"" you are asking about is not called psychosis. It's called mystical experience. Claiming you have insight into the nature of reality will not be called psychosis if one displays minimal or no impairment, and if you can convince others that what you're experiencing is a reality of a type they are willing to entertain as existing. Even still, the presence of unpleasantness/impairment need to necessarily translate into a label of pathology.

From ""Dark nights of the soul"": Phenomenology and neurocognition of spiritual suffering in mysticism and psychosis:



The similarity between psychosis and mysticism is an elephant in the room for religion and psychiatry. It's as though when they carved up their dominion over aspects of reality, psychiatry had to make some concessions. From DSM-V:



And of the experience itself, this is a description from Dostoevsky's The Idiot (1868), detailing what we would characterise as a mystical experience associated with epilepsy:


  For several instants I experience a happiness that is impossible in an
  ordinary state, and of which other people have no conception. I feel
  full harmony in myself and in the whole world, and the feeling is so
  strong and sweet that for a few seconds of such bliss one could give
  up ten years of life, perhaps all of life.
  
  I felt that heaven descended to earth and swallowed me.  I really
  attained god and was imbued with him.  All of you healthy people don't
  even suspect  what happiness is, that happiness that we epileptics
  experience for a second before an attack.

  Assuming the drugs are well tolerated in clinical trials and seem effective at treating COVID-19, the FDA will take measures to increase the nation's supply, according to Hahn.


Assuming best case scenario, when could these drugs be made widely available to treat the disease? By ""when,"" I mean how long is it likely to take?
",21638,"Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.. chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (and possibly in concert with azithromycin) have been touted over the past few days as a possible treatment regimen.

And there's some cause for that - the antiviral properties of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in vitro are broad and it's been trialed against various things (HIV, Ebola etc), however this hasn't always transferred particularly well into an actual treatment. And there's some research suggesting that it can successfully battle SARS-CoV-2 in vitro too. However, killing something in a petri dish is one thing, treating a disease in a human is another.

There has been some preliminary trials done - I believe there's been some fairly non-specific vagueness about it being promising when used in China and there's a relatively new study that's come from Gautret et al in France.

The Gautret et al paper looks promising - on the surface. It seems to suggest that treating people with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin looks great:



Unfortunately though it's not that simple.. first up we aren't talking about a great number of people here. The entire study comprised 42 patients (16 of which were the control), which isn't a huge sample size. And any patients who were on the treatment who got worse were removed from the analysis:


  Six hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were lost in follow-up during the survey because of early cessation of treatment. Reasons are as follows: three patients were transferred to intensive care unit, including one transferred on day2 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on day1, one transferred on day3 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on days1-2 and one transferred on day4 post-inclusion who was PCR- positive on day1 and day3; one patient died on day3 post inclusion and was PCR-negative on day2; one patient decided to leave the hospital on day3 post-inclusion and was PCR-negative on days1-2; finally, one patient stopped the treatment on day3 post-inclusion because of nausea and was PCR-positive on days1-2-3. 


So the picture isn't quite as rosy as the graph makes it look. Some people on this treatment still got worse, one died.

It get's even shonkier (technical term) when you look at the large swathes of control patients who didn't have the PCR test done for viral loads:



They effectively only properly measured the viral loads for 4 of the 16 control patients, so trying to compare the groups is verging on meaningless.

So before we look at ""when"" they'll be widely available to treat SARS-CoV-2 I'd be more concerned with answering whether they should be used to treat it. Hydroxychloroquine is not exactly harmless - while less toxic to humans than chloroquine, it's not something to give lightly, it can have immunosuppressant effects, and in sufficient dosages can result in potentially lethal cardiotoxicity.

It may yet prove to be an effective treatment - and the WHO is trialing it (along with other potential treatments) as part of their mega-trial SOLIDARITY, but let's not get too excited just yet.

Furthermore, the fact that there have been no or near no deaths amongst children raises the speculative possibility that previous exposure might make the illness worse since children have fewer years of exposure to seasonal coronaviruses.

  Now researchers in Hong Kong have said that recovered coronavirus patients can be left with damaged lungs.
  
  A small study of 12 patients discharged from hospital showed that two or three had reduced lung function. However, it is too early to confirm any long-term effects.
  
  ""In some patients, lung function could decline by about 20 to 30% after recovery,"" says Dr. Owen Tsang Tak-yin, medical director of the Infectious Diseases Centre at Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong.
  
  Computer tomography have shown fluid- or debris-filled sacs in the lungs, which may get progressively worse as the illness develops.


What can determine the long term effects?

Why can this:

""In some patients, lung function could decline by about 20 to 30% after recovery,"" happen?

Are elderly more likely to this? or it could happen to anyone?

Does this only happen if you had severe symptoms?
",21682,"The best theoretical model we have is that the SARS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses knock out the ACE2 receptor found on numerous tissues including alveolar cells, and myocytes, and intestinal luminal cells.

If those cells have died then they need to be replaced, and if and until when that happens there will be reduced organ function.

CT scans of recovered patients show some have ground glass changes pointing to extensive damage and scarring which may be irreversible.

Following on from that logic, would it make sense for a person over 60 (of generally good health and a non-smoker) to purposely contract COVID some time this summer, so as to have immunity next winter?  (Obviously, if the person did that, they would strictly quarantine themselves.)

I've understood that social distancing practices are partly designed to smear out infections, so they don't all hit a community suddenly like a tsunami.  So, that leads me to think that it would be beneficial for society to have new cases occur in a staggered way.

Think of something sad and depressing: Although this can be unpleasant, it usually takes care of the uncontrollable urge to laugh. If sadness doesn't work, fear is also extremely effective. Think of a scene from a horror movie you just saw or a car accident. This is physically proven to work because the adrenaline (the fear hormone) released from your brain when you have these thoughts will block out the endorphins (the happiness or laughing hormone). It may take some practice to convince yourself enough of the fear, but once you have mastered it, it's very effective.
Force yourself to turn your laugh into a cry: if the occasion is something sad such as a funeral. Some people sound like they are laughing before they cry.

•If it gets really bad, hold your nose and cover your mouth with that hand. Then people can't see your grin, and you can laugh as hard as you wish inside yourself. You may start shaking, but that's okay, it can be covered as crying. Try not to let any sound out, but if you do ease up by accident, it sounds much like a sneeze or a strange snort.
Pretend to pick your teeth: Open your mouth wide and pretend to pick away at something stuck. Not only does it totally hide your smile, you also clean your teeth at the same time! Be careful though because the face made is funny enough to make others start laughing when they see what you're up to.

They can however have an effect on other physiological aspects of a human body, that's why, as far as I know, there can be a difference between various brands or generics. 

Answering your question:


Sometimes patients have allergies towards a component of a generic (for example its colourant) in which case the doctor has a medical reasoning to pick a brand drug.
One other reason for a doctor to prescribe a specific brand (or to
disallow others or generics) is that he has made good experience
with that specific one.
Another reason is that he is following
studies or guidelines which suggest or require a specific drug in
order to be compliant, which is sometimes necessary, because
Some health insurances only pay for the patient a certain brand drug (though they also often prefer cheaper generics, as far as I know)
If the health insurance pays any kind of drug, or the patient is paying on his own, then the doctor could prescribe a specific drug also because he was convinced by pharmaceutical representatives to try out new drugs they advertise
Also, if paid by the patient, those new drugs can be prescribed and the results could be collected (anonymously) and handed to the pharmaceutical companies (for evaluation) which in turn pay the doctor some legal compensation
Well and there are gifts:



  A recent letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association illustrates how effective drug advertising can be. It describes a patient who came into the hospital with an infected insect bite. The intern who first saw the patient first sensibly wanted to prescribe a nice, inexpensive penicillin, which is the drug of choice for a minor infection. But the resident overruled the intern and favored a more ""modern"" choice for this ""severely"" ill patient. He decided the patient had to have a brand-new antibiotic…at $183 a day.
  
  The attending physician who supervised the house officers checked into the incident. It turned out the resident had just been wined and dined by the drug representative whose company made the new antibiotic.

21700,Why don't we take a random sample of the population to estimate the amount of COVID-19 cases?,"Current statistics on number of cases will always be a few days behind reality due to the time between infection and going to get tested, asymptomatic people, etc. But why not take a random sample of a few thousand people people, and test all of them to see how many of them have the virus? Would that not give us a picture of the proportion of people who have the virus?
",21701,"Italy has 60 million people and around 70 thousand (known) cases. That's barely more than 1 in 1000 prevalence. For most countries it's less than this. So, you'd need a huge sample for a good estimate. And those tests/resources are better deployed where suspected cases are, for the time being.

And sensible or not, I've heard this from a colleague, and it's confirmed by the news that Romania's capital Bucharest plans to randomly test a sample of 10,500 people to determine the extent of the virus spread over there.


  Manager of the “Matei Bals” Infectious Diseases Institute Adrian Streinu-Cercel has announced that a pilot project for testing 10,500 persons for the novel coronavirus will start in Bucharest within a scientific study to detect those infected with SARS CoV-2 virus, from the desire to thus prevent the severe forms of illness.
  
  Streinu-Cercel mentioned that, for a population of approximately 2 million inhabitants, the testing of 9,558 persons is necessary, with a correction of 10% being applied to this number. He also stated that the sample can be resized along the way. In this regard, Streinu-Cercel referred to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, which asked that testing be conducted to detect COVID 19. The manager of the “Matei Bals” Institute showed that it is necessary to test the medical staff and patients, but also the population, in order to know if “it’s healthy, if it is currently infected or went through the infection” with this virus, these three pieces of information completely changing how this pandemic is approached in the near future. [...]
  
  Streinu-Cercel underscored that, in lack of screening, the mild forms can go undetected, generating subsequent forms of severe infections. He also mentioned that the Minister of Health approved this project and stressed that this is a study with “scientific value,” not a simple testing. At the same time, he mentioned that in Bucharest there are 188 people diagnosed positively.


Note that ~200 cases in 2M is 1:10,000.

Ha, ha, the more amusing part is that this turned out to be ""fake news!"" But it's actually informative to read the ""retraction/information"" as to why they are not actually doing such a study [obviously: insufficient testing capacity for the proposed sample.]


  After the manager of the “Matei Bals” Institute for Infectious Diseases, Adrian Streinu-Cercel and Bucharest mayor Gabriela Firea had announced on Thursday that 10,514 people from 5 different age groups in Bucharest will be tested for the novel Coronavirus, PM Ludovic Orban reacted and said this is not possible.
  
  “We cannot establish the people to be tested randomly. Selecting 10,000 are just stories, there is a priority list for testing, it depends on how the situation and the testing capacity are developing,” the PM told a conference at the Health Ministry’s HQs.
  
  Orban said that the medical staff and those targeted by the epidemiological inquiries are qualifying for testing first, adding that “Romania has not been ready and the testing capacity has been limited”.
  
  The premier said that “the testing capacity in Romania will increase up to 2,000 next week” and will gradually rise, but to select 10,000 people “are just stories”, the more the death toll has been low in Romania.


In older news I see that India conducted a random test on 500 of their citizens. Rather predictably, they all came out negative.

By the way, if what you want to find out are the proportion of asymptomatic cases, there are some studies (albeit on fairly contained populations) that may have an answer to that, e.g. one on the Diamond Princess (the cruise ship quarantined off Japan):


  [Overall:] Our estimated asymptomatic proportion is at 17.9% (95%CrI: 15.5–20.2%), which overlaps with a recently derived estimate of 33.3% (95% confidence interval: 8.3–58.3%) from data of Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan.
  
  [Caveat:] Considering that most of the passengers were 60 years and older, the nature of the age distribution may lead to underestimation if older individuals tend to experience more symptoms. 


From a 2nd study on the Diamond Princess, it's informative to read the testing strategy/order:


  Overall 3,063 PCR tests were performed among [the 3,711] passengers and crew members. Testing started among the elderly passengers, descending by age.

21702,Confusing COVID article - Why would keeping the doubling time above the incubation period flatten the curve?,"I stumbled upon this boiled down news article which makes the statement that if we get the doubling time for coronavirus cases above the incubation period (5.8 days), we will be able to effectively ""flatten the curve"".

Could someone explain to me the logic behind that statement? Can't wrap my head around it. Even if the doubling time  is 6 days, in theory (I realise the curve will naturally flatten as a result of population size and number of people already infected) you're still going to see an exponential increases in cases (i.e. 50000, 100000, 200000, 400000...)
",21704,"One of the issues with COVID-19 is the fact that it is transmissible even by people who are asymptomatic. You've probably heard about R0, which is the basic reproduction rate of a disease, that takes into account transmission modes and contact rate, among other things. I'm not an epidemiologist, but I'm operating under the assumption that someone who is obviously sick will infect relatively fewer people than someone who is asymptomatic, assuming similar contagiousness - the sick person should quarantine themself and clearly take measures to avoid spreading their sickness. A seemingly well individual, on the other hand, may not reduce their contact rate and unwittingly spread the disease. 

Under this assumption, consider what happens when the incubation time is equal to the doubling rate. Suppose we have 1000 individuals who have the disease, but don't know it yet because they are still in the incubation period. 5.8 days later, there are now 2000 people with the disease, 1000 of which now feel sick, and 1000 of which still feel fine. Those 1000 sick people quarantine themselves, dramatically lowering their rate of infecting others, let's say to 0 for the sake of simplicity. 5.8 days later, the 1000 asymptomatic people now feel sick, after having infected another 1000 people, although the 1000 already-sick individuals haven't infected anyone else. At this rate, we have a linear increase in the number of cases, since old cases are quarantining themselves at the same rate new cases are spread - the number of people spreading the disease unwittingly remains constant!

I've made several assumptions here, like that the transmission rate for asymptomatic individuals is higher than that of symptomatic individuals (although some symptoms, like cough, increase infectivity, and not all symptomatic individuals quarantine appropriately). I'm also not sure this is really an appropriate use of ""doubling time"" - strictly speaking, if 1000 people quarantine, and 1000 asymptomatic people infect 1000 others, it is not a doubling of cases. The statement also seems a bit of tautological red herring - if you are able to lengthen the doubling time, you have already flattened the curve, regardless of the incubation period. But I think the general idea is that a longer doubling time can lessen the impact of asympomatic, but contagious individuals spreading the disease.

Bike sharing is probably safe and healthy, as long as you take certain hygiene and disinfection precautions, as explained in later sections.
Don't ride when sick.
Exercise, in moderation, may strengthen the immune system.
Sun exposure may help you synthesize vitamin D. It's possible that this vitamin somewhat helps protect against COVID-19.


Introduction

It's probably safe and healthy to use bike-sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic — as long as you take some simple precautions.

If you take these precautions, bike-sharing is probably safer than public transit during the pandemic. (Source.)

Please note: If you're sick, please don't use bike sharing. Please use your own car or bike. Or, better yet, please stay home. (Source.)

Hygiene


After riding, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. (Source.)
If you can't access soap or water, carry and use hand sanitizer instead.


Disinfecting handlebars

You might have thought it unnecessary to disinfect handlebars, for three reasons.


The CDC writes: ""It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. But this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.""
On stainless steel, coronavirus particles can survive for two days, but virus titers start to plummet after just four hours. (Source.)
Ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun seems to destroy coronaviruses. (Source.)


However, during the pandemic, various experts do recommend that you disinfect bike-share bike handlebars and brake levers. If a sick person used a bike right before you, they might have left their germs on the handlebars; disinfection can kill these germs. (Source.)

70% rubbing alcohol solution is probably a good disinfectant to use here.


At home:


Dampen a clean rag, or some paper towels, with 70% rubbing alcohol solution.
Store the result an air-tight bag, so that the alcohol doesn't evaporate.

Later, at the bike-share station:


Dampen the handlebars and brake levers with the solution. Let them stay damp for at least 30 seconds.



In theory, alcohol probably shouldn't damage most rubber items. (Source.) But please see the comments on this post.

Disinfecting wipes containing benzalkonium chloride (e.g. Lysol wipes) are another option. Benzalkonium chloride may promote antibiotic resistance and is toxic to fish. If you do use Lysol wipes, wash your hands after use and before eating.

If there are shortages of disinfecting wipes or rubbing alcohol in your city: Please consider leaving these items for sick people who truly need them. Instead, please avoid touching your face, and wash your hands after riding.

Exercise may strengthen the immune system

The research literature suggests that exercise, if done in moderation, probably strengthens the immune system. (Source.) During a pandemic, experts recommend against exercising in crowded spaces, or beyond the point of exhaustion, or when feeling flu-like symptoms. (Source.)

Sun exposure may protect against COVID-19

When your skin is exposed to moderate amounts of sunlight, it may synthesize vitamin D. (Don't get sunburned; this increases your risk of skin cancer.) Getting enough vitamin D may reduce, but not eliminate, your risk of catching COVID-19. (Source: a MedCram video citing a BMJ meta-analysis. Please see also this BMJ press release and this post.) Regular outdoor exercise may help you to get more sun and to synthesize more vitamin D.

There are other ways to get vitamin D, such as from daily pills; but the details are beyond the scope of this post.

Notes

I'm not a doctor. This thread is for educational purposes only; it is not intended as a substitute for personalized advice from a doctor.
",Reasonable,"As a practicing epidemiologist, I'm actually a little puzzled as to the down-votes for this. The difference between an outbreak and an epidemic is pretty subtle, and neither is all that terribly well defined.

The answer: There's not much of a difference.

The CDC agrees with me:


  Occasionally, the amount of disease in a community rises above the
  expected level. Epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in the
  number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that
  population in that area. Outbreak carries the same definition of
  epidemic, but is often used for a more limited geographic area.


In practice, I'd argue that an outbreak is, as they mentioned, a somewhat smaller-scale phenomena. I'd talk about an outbreak of norovirus at a university, while I'd say a state, large city or country was having an epidemic. 

I'd also say that, for very low levels of disease, it's possible to have an outbreak without an epidemic. For example, in a paper I wrote, I characterized the cases of disease in a population as ""Low-level endemic spread, punctuated by periodic, short-lived outbreaks"". These outbreaks were on the scale of less than a dozen people, so I'd really have a hard time calling it an epidemic, but again, this is referencing the idea that ""outbreak"" refers to a somewhat smaller geographical scale.

Shortness of breath is a more advanced symptom than cough whereas in asthma shortness of breath is usual.

Furthermore shortness of breath in asthma is due to reversible narrowing of small airways so that should respond to usual bronchodilator medication.  But the shortness of breath in Covid-19 is at the alveolar level beyond the small airways and will not be helped by bronchodilator therapy.

In short, if an asthma patient has shortness of breath, fever, and cough where the shortness of breath does not respond to bronchodilator therapy, then in the context of the current covid-19 pandemic there is a high probability that this is covid-19 disease.
",Reasonable,"I'll assume by ""stomach"", you mean abdominal pain, probably lower abdominal pain. And yes, tampons can cause lower abdominal pain in the presence of endometriosis (ectopic endometrial tissue). The symptoms of endometriosis can include pain on micturition, defecation, tampon or diaphragm insertion, increased pain with menses, intercourse, etc.

Use of tampons in healthy females is generally well-tolerated.

Edited to address OP's edit:

Tampons are generally well tolerated by healthy, normal females. However, there are groups of females that do find tampon use uncomfortable, chief among them adolescents. For this reason, physicians often speak with adolescents at menarche about tampon use.


  With regard to comfort, girls often choose tampons of too high absorbency. Highly absorbent tampons may cause discomfort in young girls because of their larger size or because of a drying effect during wear and upon withdrawal. Advise your patient to choose the lowest tampon absorbency for her needs by experimenting with a pad or pantiliner for backup protection. Less absorbent products can be used on lighter days. This guidance is also consistent with the Food and Drug Administration’s current recommendations for reducing the risk of menstrual toxic shock syndrome.


In other words, young girls should use smaller tampons. Pain with tampon use in this age group is more likely and in some cases can lead to problems with pain later on.

The Chinese CDC report has a slightly different definition


  The authors of the Chinese CDC report divided the clinical manifestations of the disease by there (sic) severity:
  
  Mild disease: non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia; this occurred in 81% of cases.
  
  Severe disease: dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥ 30/min, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio or P/F [the ratio between the blood pressure of the oxygen (partial pressure of oxygen, PaO2) and the percentage of oxygen supplied (fraction of inspired oxygen, FiO2)] &lt; 300, and/or lung infiltrates > 50% within 24 to 48 hours; this occurred in 14% of cases.
  
  Critical disease: respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) or failure (MOF); this occurred in 5% of cases.[12]


The decision to move from high flow oxygen (nasal cannula) to masks and then ventilation (proning) is based on standard protocols for viral pneumonia. ECMO is used when even ventilation is unable to maintain satisfactory oxygen levels.

Covid-19 has an odd characteristic of patients with mild hypoxemia suddenly compensating and needing to be rapidly intubated.  As a side note, intubating these patients is one of the most risky of procedures for medical personnel as it places them into very close proximity to a very sick patient who is expelling lots of virus.

The concept that REM atonia is under the control of one physiological mechanism and one neurotransmitter pathway has seduced many of us.  


In summary, it seems that ""sleep paralysis"" is actually not that far off a choice to use for REM atonia judging by real world word usage. But in any case a further qualification like ""during real sleep""?

This excerpt seems to set a very straght record:


  Neural mechanisms prevent us from acting out our dreams during REM sleep. This normal “paralysis” during REM known as REM atonia is altered in patients with narcolepsy. Sleep paralysis is the intrusion of the normal atonia of REM sleep into wakefulness. The patient experiences inability to move with preserved aware- ness of surroundings. Sleep paralysis typically occurs during sleep–wake transitions or arousals.

21733,What are the recommendations for interacting with vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"What preventative measures should people take to avoid infecting others that they are in contact with, such as family members, who are more vulnerable (elderly and/or individuals with underlying health conditions) to the virus?

In particular, what should be done when someone needs to leave home regularly for work, despite having contact with vulnerable people at home?
",21748,"If your relative stays at home without contact with anyone from the outside world, they have zero risk of getting the disease.  If a  relative living in the house needs to leave daily they risk exposure and getting the infection.  The relative at home now has a non-zero risk of getting infected.

If the relative at home is independent then they should be left to live alone, and the working relative move in with someone else.  If that's not possible, then another person not known to be infected should move in with her, and the working relative moves out.

If the working relative is the main carer for the relative at home, and the above choices are not possible, then they have to manage the situation as though they already have the virus.

The recommendation is that you are not going to transmit the infection to someone who remains at a 6 foot distance away from you, and if inside that distance for less than 10-15 minutes.  So, that stops viral droplets from one person passing to the next.

Viral nuclear droplets form when aerosols develop, eg flushing the toilet, so the toilet lid needs to stay down when flushing, and keep windows open.  Even better still use different bathrooms, or build a composting toilet away from the bathroom shared with the other person.  If you're not able to not share bathrooms, then all the surfaces needs to be wiped down with .1% solution of bleach after each use of the bathroom, and left to dry for 10-30 minutes.  Each door knob needs to be disinfected. There can't be any shared eating utensils.  And most importantly the hands need to be washed for a minimum of 20 seconds using a soap/detergent.

Even if people live together, studies in China showed that cross infection was not inevitable, but closer to 20% of households had transmission.

",Reasonable,"Yes. 

This is one of the few areas of primary prevention* where the data are clear. 

The (intelligently) skeptical tone of your question suggests to me that you would be (appropriately) wary of drawing conclusions based on observational data or surrogate endpoints. Fortunately, you have asked a question about an area where rigorous data are available showing reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality on the basis of randomized, controlled trials.

Cardiovascular events  

In large-scale randomized trials of people with primary hypertension,  antihypertensive therapy produces a nearly 50 percent relative risk reduction in the incidence of heart failure, a 30 to 40 percent relative risk reduction in stroke, and a 20 to 25 percent relative risk reduction in myocardial infarction.1,2,3,4 

The benefits show a consistent ""dose-response"" relationship. That is, larger improvements in blood pressure control are associated with greater decreases in risk. This is an important point, since it adds credibility to the association. This is demonstrated in graphs like this one:



Image from Reference 1, below: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2386598/  

On the x-axis you see the degree of blood pressure lowering achieved with medications. On the y-axis is “relative risk” (RR). By definition, a null intervention yields RR=1. A relative risk of 0.5 represents a 50% decreased risk, etc. 

The graph is showing meta-analysis data, i.e. data compiled from many clinical trials in order to increase statistical power. The basic idea is that each circle is a clinical trial and bigger circles represent “stronger” data (i.e. with lower variance). The regression line shows that there is a linear relationship between the degree of blood pressure lowering and the relative risk reduction (here for a composite endpoint of stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.) This analysis included 31 randomized, placebo-controlled trials, with 190,606 participants. These are strong data. 

Mortality data  

In addition to the dramatic reductions in adverse cardiovascular outcomes, blood pressure control has also been shown to reduce mortality. One meta-analysis used data from 42 randomized, controlled studies including nearly 200,000 subjects (Psaty). They found a reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.92); and total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96). The fact that these relative risk (RR) confidence intervals do not cross 1 demonstrates statistical significance. 

Although the RR value of 0.90 is considerably less impressive than the reductions in more specific outcomes (stroke, heart failure, etc), this is expected due to the myriad of other factors affecting mortality. A statistically significant relative risk of 0.90 for mortality is actually quite dramatic. One would be challenged to find any other intervention for primary prevention that, in randomized trials, can be shown to decrease overall mortality with this degree of certainty.

Conclusion  

There are many interventions in modern medicine that are of questionable long-term benefit to healthy patients (i.e. primary prevention).** These include cholesterol lowering medications, aspirin, various forms of cancer screening, etc. In most cases, the disease-specific improvements in outcomes are subtle and debated, and randomized data showing a reduction in overall mortality are lacking or inconsistent. The use of blood pressure lowering medications in patients with hypertension falls into a different category. These medications are effective. 


*That is, interventions aimed at preventing disease in healthy people. This is in contrast to secondary prevention, treating people after they have already had an adverse outcome. In general, secondary prevention is a much ""easier"" arena in which to demonstrate benefit because the risk of adverse outcomes is so much higher.
   


**Here, I’m considering hypertension, hyperlipidemia to fall within the range of “healthy” because these abnormalities are only problematic if they cause a cardiovascular event of some sort.

Would symptoms differ from eating virus contaminated food versus breathing in virus?
Would symptoms be a good indicator where the virus is located?
The COVID-19 causes respiratory symptoms and I guess that is because people are breathing in virus droplets in their lungs. But if you would swallow COVID-19 contaminated food and avoid breathing in the virus would that cause other symptoms like stomach pain or diarrhea?

",21751,"Well this is a guess because there is no published data that I am aware of in the english literature to be able to answer the question.

A small percentage of people who have presented with covid-19 pneumonia have also had diarrhoea, it is thought that the faecal-oral route is also an important mode of transmission.  

If the person develops a respiratory infection the affected cells will eventually spill virus into the circulation, a condition called viraemia. This allows the virus to reach distant cells that bear the ACE2 surface receptor and these cells are also in the heart, kidneys and gut as well as monocytes.  One would also expect that intestinal cells affected primarily by ingestion of virus particles would also do the same, and produce a viraemia leading to the virus spreading to the lungs, heart and kidneys.  But they may present initially with diarrhoea before getting respiratory symptoms.
",Reasonable,"Eating large amounts of carbs is not good if you already have diabetes or are prediabetic. But otherwise, whole grain carbs are very healthy. Type-2 diabetes is not caused by eating carbs, but by eating fat. This is explained in detail here. As pointed out in this lecture, countries like Japan where people used to eat large amounts of carbs used to have low rates of diabetes, and that changed when they started to eat less carbs and more fat.

Fat consumption at levels considered to be normal in the West is not only implicated in diabetes, it also causes cardiovascular disease. This was first rigorously established in the late 1950s, see also here for an article on this subject by the first author written more than 50 years later.

A more recent research result:


  ...the Tsimane, a forager-horticulturalist population of the Bolivian Amazon with few coronary artery disease risk factors, have the lowest reported levels of coronary artery disease of any population recorded to date.


And note how similar the diets of the Tsimane and the Africans in Uganda are, e.g. they both get less than 20% of their calories from fat. 

In general, it's not good to argue on the basis of X is bad because it will cause adverse health effects to people suffering from disease Y. Take e.g. X to be strenuous exercise and Y to be heart disease. Exercise can lower the risk of heart disease, but once you got heart disease, the exercise intensity may need to be limited.

21744,Does bleach have to be diluted to be more effective to kill virus?,"This page Bleach claims 


  Bleach is more effective at killing germs when diluted than when used
  straight out of the bottle.


this other page (Spanish) Alcohol and Bleach are more effective against Coronavirus diluted claims the same


  Disinfectants like bleach and alcohol alter the virus structure and
  prevent it from infecting us. Their effects will depend in the right
  concentration


But this other page, Does liquid bleach has to be diluted to be effective as a virus killer?

claims 


  So, all things being equal, undiluted bleach is more effective at
  killing stubborn bacteria.


I know, he says bacteria and not virus but, 


  The data of viruses is a little more straight forward � viruses are
  simply not cut out to defend against the bleach onslaught! A group of
  scientists in New York studied the effects of very dilute
  concentrations of bleach on the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A
  tenfold dilution of bleach, which subsequently mixed with an equal
  volume of RSV-containing medium (so in fact a twentyfold dilution)
  eradicated all of the virus. A 100-fold dilution of bleach killed 100%
  of the virus half of the time, and decreased the number of live viral
  particles by greater than three logs in the other half of the tests.
  This was all after five minutes of treatment.
  
  So at least for viruses, you can probably dilute the bleach tenfold
  without worrying too much about decreased antimicrobial activity.


Personally, I don't find any logic why bleach would be more effective diluted, the opposite makes more sense to me. Is there any explanation for this to be so? Or it's just a wrong idea?
",21756,"The text does not say that more diluted bleach is more effective at killing viruses (or bacteria, or yeast, for that matter). 

I'm quoting:

...A tenfold dilution of bleach, which subsequently mixed with an equal volume of RSV-containing medium (so in fact a twentyfold dilution) eradicated all of the virus. A 100-fold dilution of bleach killed 100% of the virus half of the time, and decreased the number of live viral particles by greater than three logs in the other half of the tests. This was all after five minutes of treatment...

So a 20-fold dilution kills all virus always; a 100-fold dilution kills 100% of the virus 50% of the time and kills most of them in the other cases. 

I think form this we can conclude that more highly concentrated bleach is more deadly to viruses than more diluted bleach. 
",Reasonable,"This is a hot topic, and I don’t think there is a firm consensus in the child psychiatry world about the answer. I think a good summary of the literature would leave you with: 


  X, Y, and Z studies showed an association; Χ, Ψ, and Ω studies showed no association.


Excellent. Ιn lieu of that, I'm going to use one study to illustrate a couple methodological points to show you why this answer is difficult to know. My goal is to help the reader develop a skeptical eye when research of this type is presented.

One study used teacher questionnaires about hyperactivity symptoms and student questionnaires about dietary habits to see if a relationship existed between high sugar intake and hyperactivity. They found that children were at statistically higher risk for ADHD if they consumed:  


less sugar from fruit snacks  
low Vitamin C 


However, the total simple sugar intake did not correlate with hyperactivity symptoms.

This makes very little sense. Why should fruit snacks be different from other sugar, and where did Vitamin C come from?


Statistical noise. Data interpretation relies on a ratio of signal:noise to find the signal (in this case, an association). A 5-second brainstorm will bring to mind dozens of unrelated (to usual dietary patterns) topics that may affect what students write down on questionnaires: literacy, gender, upbringing, vocabulary, organization, memory, day-of-the-week, recent holidays, who won the Red Sox game, etc. etc. etc. Some of these may reflect recent dietary patterns that skew the memory of usual dietary patterns; others simply affect the accuracy of report. One could generate an equally diverse list of factors that may affect teacher reports. Either way, the result is the same: a noisy signal.
Confounding. A confound exists when an extraneous factor exists that correlates with both the independent (dietary report) and the dependent (inattentiveness) variable. In this case, one could imagine that students who tend to be careless about reporting might also be those displaying symptoms of hyperactivity (which tends to run with inattentiveness). It’s not obvious whether that would lead to under or over reporting of sugar intake. 

Generally, obvious confounders can be adjusted for statistically (here, I don't see that they did much of that, although they did do separate analyses for boys vs girls). However, no amount of math can adjust for factors that aren’t measured. There was no “carelessness independent of hyperactivity” score obtained here, and we couldn’t expect it &mdash; it’s a basically unknowable parameter. Certain confounders are inherent to the methodology. Math never fixes this.
Multiple comparisons. The basic principle is: if you look at enough factors, something is going to be statistically associated with something else for reasons that have nothing to do with reality. That’s because we define statistical significance as a result that would occur by chance &lt;5% of the time. If you run 20 tests, you have a good chance of coming up with one of them that appears to be positive simply by chance. In data that has a low signal:noise ratio (see #1), this problem is all the more apparent. This is something to think about when unexpected results pop up from a study that was designed to look at something completely different. Vitamin C??!


Please note: this is not meant to be (primarily) a critique of this particular study. My goals here were to help the reader understand: 


Why do I find different answers to this question every time I do a google search?   
How should we think critically about epidemiological data presented on Health.SE?

  in the last two weeks, a promising pilot study here has produced results that may be instructive for other countries trying to control coronavirus. Beginning on 6 March , along with researchers at the University of Padua and the Red Cross, we tested all residents of Vò, a town of 3,000 inhabitants near Venice – including those who did not have symptoms. This allowed us to quarantine people before they showed signs of infection and stop the further spread of coronavirus. In this way, we eradicated coronavirus in under 14 days. [...]
  
  Our experiment came to be by chance. The Italian authorities had a strong emotional reaction to news of the country’s first death – which was in Vò. The whole town was put into quarantine and every inhabitant was tested. The tests were processed by us at the University of Padua. [...]
  
  In the first round of testing, 89 people tested positive. In the second round, the number had dropped to six, who remained in isolation. In this way, we managed to eradicate coronavirus from Vò, achieving a 100% recovery rate for those previously infected while recording no further cases of transmission.


Strong claims here. They also say/claim that


  asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic subjects represent a good 70% of all virus-infected people


referring to COVID-19.

About the authors, the Guardian notes:


  Andrea Crisanti is professor of microbiology at the University of Padua; Antonio Cassone is a former director of the department of infectious diseases at the Italian institute of health.


I guess I now know whose publications to look at (in the future).

There's a longer interview with Crisanti on CBC.ca. An intersting bit:


  I want to draw a comparison. If you remember the Diamond Princess. They started with few cases. They did the tests only to those [who] were symptomatic. So you develop a symptom, you test positive, you were taken out of the ship. 
  
  But day by day, cases, if you remember, they increased up to more than 700. So in this way, they couldn't stop the disease. That couldn't stop the disease in spite of the fact that they were isolated, they were kind of quarantined. And the reason why they couldn't stop it is because the ship was full of asymptomatic people that [were] spreading the virus. 
  
  Q: [When you started this in February], the protocol was that you tested people only if they … were returning from a foreign place, or from China, or if they had symptoms. ... You ignored that and went to everybody.
  
  Yeah, we ignored that because we weren't convinced that the disease was transmitted only by symptomatic individuals. We found this quite implausible. And so this is the reason why we tested everybody.

Is either or both the main mechanism of spread in the lung? Does lymphatic spread play any role?

The disease is spread by droplets full of virus, and it is likely that the patient in coughing is spreading the virus to other parts of the lung.

But this is speculative as the disease progression has not yet been fully characterised.

",Reasonable,"Salty foods are generally either carby (chips/crisps, fries/chips, popcorn) or proteiny (meat, cheese, nuts.) Most carby snacks have no way to make the salt stick without the fat. Air popped popcorn, for example, the salt just falls off.  Ditto microwave or oven crisps. You can reduce the fat and change the fat and that may help. For example oven-baked potato wedges with just a little oil. Air popped popcorn with a tiny drizzle of butter. They sell low fat crackers that are salty but apparently they are high in sugar.

You'll have better luck going the protein route. For those who eat meat, lean meat most certainly exists. I make my own jerky, which is very salty and satisfying. There are also low- and no-fat sliced meats (chicken, turkey, ham) though these need to be kept cool and can't just be pulled out of your pocket for a nibble on the bus. I have seen dried sausages, pepperoni-style, in a snack size and a low-fat variant.

If you have the ability to prepare a little, a salt-lover in my family loves to dip spring onions (green onions - the long thin things that are white at one end and green at the other) in salt a bite at a time. 

If you have a home dehydrator, try beet chips: slice beet(root) very thin, lay out on dehydrator trays, sprinkle a pinch of sea salt on each (the juices will make it stick / soak in) and then dry them. I really enjoy these and they are fat-free. Once made, they keep for ages and can be taken with you for an on-the-go snack.

Or internal ventilators.

Under such perspective, a common refrigerator would act moreover as a Petri dish. Completely different from the rest of house surfaces, which would allow viruses vanishing way more faster.

  There is no evidence so far of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the handling of bodies of deceased persons.
  The potential risk of transmission related to the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or
  confirmed COVID-19 is considered low and can be related to:
  * direct contact with human remains or bodily fluids where the virus is present
  * direct contact with contaminated fomites.
  
  As viable SARS-CoV-2 may persist on surfaces for days [7], there is the possibility that the virus also persists on
  deceased bodies. Therefore, unnecessary contact with bodies should be minimised by those not wearing personal
  protective equipment (PPE). Those in direct contact with deceased cases of COVID-19 (both suspected or
  confirmed) should be protected from exposure to infected bodily fluids, contaminated objects, or other
  contaminated environmental surfaces through wearing of appropriate PPE. Minimum requirements include gloves
  and a long-sleeved water-resistant gown.

",Reasonable,"Vitamin B is a misnomer, think of it not as 1 vitamin but as ""B Vitamins"", because there are 8 that are essential to good micro-nutrition.

B vitamins are found in whole unprocessed foods. Processed carbohydrates such as sugar/white flour tend to have lower B vitamin than their unprocessed counterparts. For this reason, it is required by law in many countries (including the United States) that the B vitamins thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and folic acid be added back to white flour after processing. This is sometimes called ""Enriched Flour"" on food labels.

Good sources for B vitamins include legumes (pulses or beans), whole grains, potatoes, bananas, chili peppers, tempeh, nutritional yeast, brewer's yeast, and molasses. You can find this information by reading the labels of these products. 

So far so good for vegans.

The B12 vitamin is of note because it is not available from plant products, making B12 deficiency a legitimate concern for vegans.

However, manufacturers of plant-based foods will sometimes report B12 content, leading to confusion about what sources yield B12. The confusion arises because the standard US Pharmacopeia (USP) method for measuring the B12 content does not measure the B12 directly. Instead, it measures a bacterial response to the food. Chemical variants of the B12 vitamin found in plant sources are active for bacteria, but cannot be used by the human body. This same phenomenon can cause significant over-reporting of B12 content in other types of foods as well.

Because B-vitamins are water soluble and readily excreted if they are over complimented.

Recommendation for vegetarians/vegans is to supplement Vitamin B12. The rest of the B vitamins should be obtained through legumes (pulses or beans), whole grains, potatoes, bananas and chili peppers.

22796,What is the main way COVID-19 spreads?,"Reading numerous news articles about COVID-19, I got confused as to what is its main transmission route. In particular, I am confused as to whether it is


direct landing of respiratory droplets in mouths and noses, 
contaminated surfaces,
aerosols (i.e., suspensions of the virus in the air rather than respiratory droplets quickly landing in mouths or noses or on surfaces), or
something else.


On the one hand, the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that contaminated surfaces are not thought to be the main transmission route:


  It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. (Link)


The same website appears to suggest that the main transmission route is  direct landing of respiratory droplets in mouths and noses:


  The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
  
  
  Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
  Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
  
  
  These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.


On the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO), like many other agencies, puts the main emphasis on washing hands. Here is the WHO's first and foremost piece of advice on how to prevent getting infected with the virus: 


  Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. (Link)


Social distancing is mentioned on that webpage only as a second piece of advice, and, furthermore, the webpage implies that it is safe to approach coughing people as close as 1 meter away:


  Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.


Furthermore, I found an article saying that the virus wasn't detected in the air of hospital rooms with COVID-19 patients, but was detected on surfaces: 


  When researchers in Singapore tested the air in the rooms of three Covid-19 patients, they found no virus particles on cleaned surfaces or in the air even when they took samples on days the patients were symptomatic and presumably shedding virus into the air, they reported this month in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In the room of the third patient, who shed more virus, virus particles were present on ventilation fans and numerous surfaces — but all air samples were negative. (Link)


But the same article also says that Chinese researchers found COVID-19 aerosols near patients' toilets.

My question: Actually what is the main way COVID-19 spreads?
",22799,"The confusion exists because there are conflicting pronouncements from various authoritative sources but also conflicting pronouncements from the same authority.

Covid-19 is a respiratory infection spread by droplets that can be aerosolized (nuclear droplets) in certain situations such as by flushing toilets or in certain medical procedures such as intubation. However, it reaches the air it contaminates surfaces and this allows for the infection to be caught through the eyes nose and mouth with the virus being transferred from the hand.

The data from Singapore and Taiwan show that handwashing and social distancing are successful in preventing disease transmission. However, if social distancing is not rigorously enforced then you will need to wear a mask. The head of the Chinese CDC, Dr George Gao, has recommended that everyone wear a mask which is advice that contradicts most countries health ministries. This is so that the infected are not shedding as many viral particles into the environment. His advice is based on the fact that there is a high degree of asymptomatic infection in the community and these people are spreading the virus by droplets just by talking and exhaling.  The contrary advice is because they feel users are wearing masks to protect themselves, and, in the absence of training, they are almost certainly less effective at providing protection.  But trained users have a similar degree of protection with both surgical masks and N95 masks.

So the main way of disease transmission is by respiratory droplet. But the fact that health workers, NYPD officers (currently over 500) and others are getting infected wearing masks points to surface contamination as the second main mode of infection, or, possibly lack of training in wearing the masks and/or poor hand washing, or, that aerosol transmission is indeed important.

",Reasonable,"I get swollen lymph nodes all the time when I have a cold. If I push them, they kind of move back, and it hurts a little. When the cold clears up, they go back to normal.

In contrast, when the melanoma nobody knew I had metastasized to under my chin, the lump was entirely different from my swollen lymph nodes. Various medical people said ""it might just be a swollen node"" but I knew it was not. It was larger, didn't move when I pressed it, and for the first few months it didn't hurt, either. It took a long time to establish what it was, and during that time I was well aware that this was not your typical ""swollen nodes"" situation. If you can't feel any difference between a lump under your chin that you have now and one you had 6 months ago when you had a cold, that's because there probably is no difference. 

You can learn more about this at cancer.org but that doesn't really cover ""how can I tell if my swollen nodes are ok or not?"" because basically, swollen nodes are almost always ok. That's really what point 1 and 2 are about. If they've appeared when you know you have an infection, they are caused by the infection. If they go away within a week or so of the infection clearing up, they were caused by the infection. Nothing to worry about at all. Point 3 speaks to the physical differences, which to be fair you probably won't recognize until you've met a tumour, so isn't super useful in a consumer-focused list, and point 4 speaks to other cancer symptoms (nobody told me sweating was a symptom, I wish I had known that.) 

If I were giving medical advice around this it would be: ignore them until you feel you can't ignore them any longer. That's basically what I did. I think it's what most of us did. Don't be poking at your neck or armpits regularly to evaluate your lymph nodes. Most places no longer recommend monthly lump checks for breast cancer. This article mentions recommendations from Canadian sources, and I think much of that applies to trying to learn things from your own lymph nodes too.

",Reasonable,"Nitrates and nitrites cause a lot of consumer confusion. They're naturally occurring molecules in vegetables.

Several foods are sources of nitrates (salts) which are a normal part of the diet as they occur naturally and they're produced by a number of species of nitrifying bacteria. Only excessive levels can cause any health problems (methemoglobinemia).

Sodium nitrite and potassium nitrite (salts) are added to cured and processed meats as reducing agent (opposite of oxidation agent) to delay spoilage and pathogenic bacteria growth and to preserve its color.

Historically nitrite and nitrate were considered harmful food additives where they were considered carcinogenic, however recent research has change our ideas about health effects of both nitrite and nitrate and newly studies show no association between its intake and stomach or ovarian cancer. Further more, they're now considered as essential nutrients for cardiovascular health by promoting nitric oxide (NO) production.2010, 2012

However under certain conditions, nitrite can form nitrosamines, molecules that cause cancer in lab animals. This happens when nitrites are exposed to high heat during cooking or strongly acidic conditions (stomach acids), they could form carcinogenic nitrosamines2006, 2007, wiki. As the result the U.S. Department of Agriculture established the safety limits on the amount of nitrites used in meat products in order to decrease cancer risk in the population. This could indicate that nitrosamines may be carcinogenic in humans.

Although available evidence supports a positive association between nitrite and nitrosamine intake and gastric cancer (GC) and oesophageal cancer (OC), they're not conclusive2006, wiki.

The recent research suggests that nitrite preservatives have ""been found to be safe""2012. However it doesn't mean processed meats are healthy.

",Reasonable,"Remedies to control snoring:


Pillows. There is a pillow called the SONA pillow its FDA approved and is proven to work. 


  The study was performed to determine the ability of a new inclined
  pillow to treat snoring and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The SONA
  Pillow is a triangular pillow with space to place your arm under the
  head while sleeping on the side.



From the WebMD article ""7 Easy Fixes for Snoring"":


Beware sprays and pills. They can not be all they said they would be or not be properly researched to be safe or work. 


  Use caution before you self-treat with over-the-counter sprays and
  pills until you've checked with your doctor, says Sudhansu
  Chokroverty, MD, FRCP, FACP, program director for Clinical
  Neurophysiology and Sleep Medicine at JFK Medical Center in Edison,
  N.J. ""Many stop-snoring aids are marketed without scientific studies
  to support their claims,"" says Chokroverty, who is also a neuroscience
  professor at Seton Hall University's School of Health and Medical
  Sciences.

More on pillows. Utilizing full body pillows can help. Also, don't sleep on back and elevating the head of the bed can help, but may cause neck pain. Taping tennis balls to the back of your pajamas to stop yourself from lyin on your back is said to work, as well. Another warning:


  This may cause neck pain, however."" If snoring continues regardless of
  the sleep position, obstructive sleep apnea may be a cause. ""See a
  doctor in this case,"" Chokroverty says.

Keeping your nasal passage ways open and eliminating allergens. Change and clean bedding and remove dust and other allergy triggers. As for nasal passage ways:



  If snoring starts in your nose, keeping nasal passages open may help.
  It allows air to move through slower, Slaughter says. ""Imagine a
  narrow garden hose with water running through. The narrower the hose,
  the faster the water rushes through.""
  
  Your nasal passages work similarly. If your nose is clogged or
  narrowed due to a cold or other blockage, the fast-moving air is more
  likely to produce snoring.


Things to do to fix this are:


Hot showers before bed time
Netti pots
Nasal strips


NLM.NIH.GOV states simply. 


  Lose weight if you are overweight. It may help, but thin people can
  snore, too. Cut down or avoid alcohol and other sedatives at bedtime
  Don't sleep flat on your back


Those can be included with some lifestyles changes mentioned by Mayo Clinic:


Quit smoking
Get enough sleep
Raise head of bed about 4 inches


Alternative treatments mentioned are playing certain musical instruments and singing which can improve muscle control and train muscles of the upper airway. 

Seeking a doctors care is very important as snoring can be a sign of sleep apnea which can be life threatening. The cause of snoring is important and can change treatment. Also, of note is that snoring can not be cured, only controlled. 

By remedies I assumed you meant things other than surgery, implants, CPAP and Radiofrequency tissue ablation.

22893,How is Lopinavir + Ritonavir expected to stop COVID-19?,"There are four drugs being tested for effectiveness against COVID-19 in the SOLIDARITY trial.  Three of them have obvious potential mechanisms of action:


Remdesivir is an RNA polymerase inhibitor.  It might stop the virus from multiplying once it infects a cell.
Hydroxychloroquine may interfere with the spike protein the virus uses to attach to cells.
Interferon beta has general antiviral effects.


But I can't find anything that would explain why the Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination is expected to do anything.  Both drugs appear to be protease inhibitors that are fairly specific to HIV, while SARS-CoV-2 isn't even in the same general group of viruses as HIV.
",22931,"The NEJM editorial that accompanied that issue says:


  One antiviral-drug candidate is a combination of the HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir, which acts against the viral 3CL protease, has modest antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.


A quick search shows that SARS-CoV 3CL protease was the topic of some more in-depth investigations, including a theoretical Thai study of how of lopinavir might act on the 3CLpro of SARS:


  it was found that a mixture of two HIV-1 proteinase inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, exhibited some signs of effectiveness against the SARS virus. To understand the fine details of the molecular interactions between these proteinase inhibitors and the SARS virus via complexation, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro free enzyme (free SARS) and its complexes with lopinavir (SARS–LPV) and ritonavir (SARS–RTV). The results show that flap closing was clearly observed when the inhibitors bind to the active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. 
  
  [From:] Nukoolkarn et al. ""Molecular dynamic simulations analysis of ritronavir and lopinavir as SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors"" J Theor Biol. 


It's ""above my pay grade"" to comment whether that makes any sense or not as a practical approach to SARS (or Covid-19) medication, but the paper  notes that lopinavir has a similar effect on the HIV protease:


  Similarly, this kind of flap (loop) closing was also observed when inhibitors bind in the active site of HIV-1 protease (Hornak et al., 2006a, Hornak et al., 2006b).


As noted on Protopedia


  Drugs that inhibit HIV protease prevent the virus from replicating, and are crucial components of anti-HIV therapies.
  
  The proteolytic active site of HIV protease is covered by two ""flaps"". It is believed that these flaps must open to enable substrate polyprotein to enter the active site. Drugs that inhibit HIV protease tend to ""lock"" the flaps closed.


So I think they were/are hoping that 3CL plays a similarly vital role for SARS and Covid-19 virus replications, and so that drugs that close it will inhibit virus replication.

There seem to be other researchers who have considered this approach for the SARS-CoVs, so perhaps it has some merit:


  One promising approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the essential major polyprotein processing protease 3Clpro. Here we report a complete description of the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 3Clpro using fully degenerate peptide libraries consisting of all 160,000 possible naturally occurring tetrapeptides. 


There's even a library-compound-search paper like that (i.e. trying to find molecules that would inhibit its 3CL) for SARS-CoV-2 out already (published March 26) by Chinese and Saudi researchers:


  The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle. 3CLpro is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CLpro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds. Our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and drug development process to combat COVID-19.


However, this latter paper also notes that there are some key differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL proteases, so compounds that work against one might not be so effective against the other:


  results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro receptor-binding pocket conformation resembles that of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro binding pocket and raises the possibility that inhibitors intended for SARS-CoV 3CLpro may also inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.
  
  To test this hypothesis, we docked (R)-N-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-N-(2-(tert-butylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl)furan-2-carboxamide), a potential noncovalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro named ML188 [35], with the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro homology model. We also docked ML188 with the SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure (PDB ID: 3M3V) as a reference, and ML188 bound strongly to the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The inhibitor targets the Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) along with the other residues, and the docking score (S = −12.27) was relatively high. However, surprisingly, ML188 did not show significant binding to the catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2, and the docking score (S = −8.31) was considerably lower (Fig. S3). 


This paper also investigated (in the theoretical/computational sense) three other drugs of that kind that might work on the SARS-CoV-2 3CL: Nelfinavir, Prulifloxacin and Colistin. Nelfinavir is also a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV-1 and Wikipedia says it's also being investigated for COVID-19, but I haven't checked the details. Interestingly perhaps, lopinavir is not mentioned at all in this SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor screening study. I couldn't tell you exactly why, but it might be because there are at least six ""1st gen"" protease inhibitors used in HIV treatment (and some ""2nd gen"" ones) so they probably just picked one for this study as representative.

Areas which are not used to any ""friction"" so, they will react in a rather singular manner in comparison to our exposed gums, per say. Thus, providing you presently have good oral health i.e. you don't have gingivitis which causes bleeding of the gums amidst brushing. 

Initially, flossing will cause inflammation and minor bleeding however, if the bleeding is rather severe it could indicate a periodontal disease and require medical intervention. Gums, if they are ""virgins"" to interdental flossing scene, will be tender, and this is common amongst nearly all whom who haven't flossed. So, despite your concern, they will become more firm once the plaque has been plausibly removed. As your gums become less tender, they will hence become less sensitive and no longer bleed as you floss. 

Albeit, if the bleeding still prevails after a period of a week, it would be advised to either, refresh your knowledge on how to floss, or pay a visit to your dentist. The latter could conclude that, you are incorrectly flossing e.g. too much pressure and rigor.

The term rolling boil facilitates communication and assures that an effective pasteurization temperature is reached to kill or inactivate waterborne pathogens. Some agencies recommend boiling for longer periods, but this extra time is not necessary and can cause unnecessary power demand and increase safety concerns.


For cardboard boxes:


  On cardboard, no viable SARS-CoV-2 was measured after 24 hours


And on plastics/stainless steel


  SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, and viable virus was detected up to 72 hours after application to these surfaces (Figure 1A), although the virus titer was greatly reduced (from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter of medium after 72 hours on plastic and from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter after 48 hours on stainless steel).


So, it can last for 72 hours at least though at greatly diminished amounts of viable virus.  So, use soap/water to wipe these surfaces down. Soap disrupts the virus capsule, and also forms a surfactant around the virus so it can be dislodged from surfaces.

22905,When can mechanical ventilation be performed without intubation?,"(lay person here)

I have been following recent developments in DIY ventilator design, which are normally focussed on a contraption to send positive pressure in a controlled cycle. The counterargument against these initiatives is that modern ventilators are complex and do, among other things, aspiration of liquid from the lungs because patients are intubated. Intubation itself requires sedation for long periods, which brings it's own problems.  

Why is such intubation necessary. Why not have a well-sealed mask? 
",22906,"When patients have respiratory problems due to low oxygen saturation then you can supplement the O2 of room air by using high flow oxygen at various concentrations above room air using nasal cannulae or masks such as a Hudson mask.

When they are unable to maintain adequate oxygenation levels with a mask, and/or suffering respiratory muscle fatigue, they are then placed on a mechanical ventilator.  The cuff on the intubation tube is to stop secretions falling back into the lung causing aspiration pneumonia as usually at this stage the patient is no longer able to protect their own airways. 

Some people have tried CPAP devices to supply air under pressure but that has the potential disadvantage of aerosolizing virus into the environment


  While that measure could stretch the supply of ventilators and save lives, it has a major drawback. Officials and scientists have known for years that when used with a face mask, such alternative devices can possibly increase the spread of infectious disease by aerosolizing the virus, whether used in the hospital or at home.
  
  Indeed, that very scenario may have contributed to the spread of COVID-19 within a Washington state nursing home that became ground zero in the United States. First responders called to the Life Care Center of Kirkland starting Feb. 24 initially used positive airway pressure machines, often known as CPAPs, to treat residents before it was known the patients were infected with COVID-19.

Grain bags or cherry pit pillows are indeed used as a heat storage and delivery device. Only for heat delivery they currently feature as ""doesn't hurt, may help, increases comfort and well being"" for physician guidelines for lower back pain.

For the primary effect they are intended to deliver there might be even more convincing findings behind them:


  When heat over 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) is applied to the skin, heat receptors deeper down, where the pain is, are switched on. The heat receptors in turn block the effect of chemical messengers that cause pain to be detected by the body.
  Specifically, King and his colleagues discovered that a heat receptor called TRPV1 can block P2X3 pain receptors.


The filling of these bags or pillows actually does matter for a variety of reasons.

In the past they were most popularly filled with simple grains like wheat, rice or barley. This provides a nice and even, down-weighing sensation of heat. But these are problematic because of their moisture content and inherent instability. They break down and dehusk, releasing harmful dust and particles. 

If used in this way they also tend to rot and mould quickly. Also the allergenic potential of the ingredients is concerning. This is another reason for not using them to apply cold: moulding will be even quicker then. For a quick make-shift heat applicator they might still be an option, just discard them after some very few uses to make sure.

Cherry pits seem less problematic in both regards, being described as a much ""drier heat"" but they too can be quite a surprising fire hazard when brought to heat in a microwave. 

From the manufacturer of a cherry stone pillow sold as medical equipment:


  Attention: Important safety information:
  
  
  Please do observe the specified heating instructions. Prolonged heating can cause higher energy and damage the pillow (ignition hazard)!
  Please warm the pillow under supervision and ensure it is not humid!
  Let the pillow cool before the next heating!
  […]
  Important Note:
  While using the cherry stone pillow for babies / children, please also note the following:
  Make sure the product is intact and sealed properly! For loose cherry stones can cause choking hazard and suffocation!
  Use only under close adult supervision!
  Check for the suitable temperature for your child using your elbow (max. 41°C)![…]
  
  Special instructions: To prevent decay/ formation of mold:
  Do not wash the Cherry stone pillows.
  Store product dry! Protect from moisture!
  


The heat storing and distribution properties of different fillers is an obvious variable to consider. Together with a parameter that is less easy to measure: coziness.

Adding other flowers, herbs and spices is often done for the non-part of this answer from the first paragraph. But when using it for delivering heat they obviously can relase volatile substances like essential oils which can have a variety of effects. Adding lavender flowers will smell beautifully and calm you down. However, all those additives I saw added to these pillows substantially increase the mould, allergy and fire hazards. If they are known or even just suspect to be effective and wanted it's probably best to use them isolated. 

So, yes: the content of the bags does matter quite a bit. Using hard and dry kernels – like cherry pits or grape seeds – seems as good as using just pure sand; and both are better than grains or colourful mixtures of sometimes dubious effect.

Instead, they must invade a host organism and hijack its genetic instructions.

  Viruses covered in “envelopes” have the most trouble surviving outside a living cell. On surfaces, the surrounding light, heat, and dryness break down the envelope, killing the virus. (Porous surfaces pull moisture away from viruses that land on them, accelerating the destruction of the envelope.) Most rhinoviruses have such envelopes; so do some influenza viruses. Norovirus doesn’t, enabling it to last longer in the environment.

",Reasonable,"Generally, NREM phase 3 (N3) also known as deep sleep, is considered to be the sleep phase in which the body rests the most and people suddenly awakened during this phase may have unpleasant sensations and feel confused inmediately after waking up as noted by the National Sleep Foundation.

A typical sleep cycle may range between 70 to 100 minutes and N3 happens approximately about 30 minutes after the person falls asleep (after about 5 mins in phase N1 and 25 mins in phase N2). N3 itself only lasts for about 3 to 8% of the total time of all the sleep cycle. Another important note is that as the night progresses, the phases of sleep cycles shift a little bit in terms of the time they last: N3 progressively becomes shorter while N2 and REM phases become larger.

Given the latter, the answer to your question would be neither. The most detrimental case in the long term would be if the person keeps being woken up while in N3, that is about 30 mins into one of the first sleep cycles of the night and a bit more than that in the last cycles of the night due to N2 increasing. From the two scenarios you propose, you could argue that one would probably make a ""smoother"" transition between sleep and alert if the person is woken up while in N1 (start of the sleep cycle) since that is the phase in which it takes the least effort to wake up someone compared to all the other phases including REM.

These antibodies, anti-A, interfered with the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the ACE2 receptor - like a form of neutralizing antibody or natural protection.  Their small studies suggested that Group O individuals had 60% of the risk of the full population and Group A individuals an increased risk of 120%.  AB Blood group risk ranged from 148-200% increased risk.

Whether that is clinically useful remains to be seen.  Could pooled immunoglobulin from Group O individuals help infected sick Covid-19 patients?

22986,"Is South Korea doing ""random"" testing to combat covid-19 epidemic?","It is well-known that South-Korea has developed a powerful system of drive-through testing allowing them to test hundreds of thousands of person in the past two months. I was wondering whether the test-subjects all visit those testing stations on a voluntary basis (because they are worried about their health) or whether true random samples of the population are being tested, supposedly requiring a government order to have certain people take a test on a (semi)compulsory basis.

To summarize: Is SK conducting random covid-19 tests on sizeable random samples of its population? Is any other country with a major outbreak doing such a thing?

This question arose in my mind in the light of rumours that the covid-19 epidemic would have a tendency to create a pool of infected 10 times larger than reported because alledgedly the main bulk of the infected don't experience grave symptoms and do not seek out a test or diagnosis. 
",22993,"South Korea has adopted a highly technical and transparent approach to Covid-19.  By sharing where infected people have been, citizens can see if they have been in contact or near contact with the infected person, and then request a test.


  Since the first cases were confirmed, Korean public health authorities and local governments collaborated to precisely document the movement of infected people down to the minute. Authorities sought testimony, watched closed-circuit television, investigated smartphone GPS data and more, publicizing the so-called moving histories of Covid-19 patients. All local governments share information through websites, text messages, and media. Companies have developed apps that allow users to visualize the information. Koreans can now learn where infected people went, when they were there, and how they got there. If someone learns they might have been exposed, they can quickly visit a doctor and begin self-quarantine if they have similar symptoms.
  
  On February 4, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took advantage of the post-MERS reform and authorized an unlicensed Covid-19 test; the government went on to test an extraordinary number of people. By February 26, Korea had tested 46,127 cases, while by that point, Japan had tested just 1,846 cases and the United States only 426. Tests still remain hard to come by in the United States, despite the Trump administration’s repeated suggestions that widespread testing is imminent.


There are few countries as technologically advanced as South Korea that are able to adopt this approach without a wide spread lockdown.  And it helped that they allowed the use of an unapproved tests whereas in the USA the CDC blocked the use of independent tests which has lead to their current deplorable state of testing.


  Following the end of the MERS outbreak, South Korea enacted a new law in 2016 that allows laboratories to use unapproved in-vitro diagnostic kits in the case of a public health emergency.

",Reasonable,"Acne can be caused by several things, one of which is bacteria. The bacteria involved in acne are called Propionibacterium acnes. This bacteria species usually only colonizes the skin. Its main source of energy are the products of skin glands. In people with overactive glands, they grow to large numbers, and their byproducts lead to the inflammation known as acne. 

Dental abscesses are caused by a variety of anaerobic bacteria and the toxins they produce. Propionibacterium acnes would not get to the location of the dental abcess and would not outcompete the anaerobic bacteria in there because it is relatively slow growing while the bacteria causing the dental abscess are fast growing under the conditions present. 

Furthermore, there is no need for this anyway. Propionibacterium acnes is present on the skin of most healthy adults. 

There is, however, one case report from 1999 linking a case of dental abscess with the appearance of acne. The full case report is not accessible anymore and I can't find any paper citing it. That case report, however, also does not propose the mechanism you describe. 


  We believe that the presence of our patient's dental infections provoked a follicular inflammatory response resulting in his recalcitrant acne.

So, there is no expectation that if you catch the disease late in its spread that the clinical disease is going to be any different from any other time that it's caught.


  Now, more diversity is emerging. Like all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 evolves over time through random mutations, only some of which are caught and corrected by the virus’s error correction machinery. Over the length of its 30,000-base-pair genome, SARS-CoV-2 accumulates an average of about one to two mutations per month, Rambaut says. “It’s about two to four times slower than the flu,” he says. Using these little changes, researchers can draw up phylogenetic trees, much like family trees. They can also make connections between different cases of COVID-19 and gauge whether there might be undetected spread of the virus.

11630,Prediction model for spread of coronavirus,"A previous thread on Bioinformatics StackExchange citing an article by the Economist which references a cartoon of predictive outcomes by the CDC (Economist article on coronavirus) suggests a model in epidemiology using the ""basic reproductive rate"", commonly known as R0. Although I'm no bioinformatician, I imagine that one could tweak a model based on similar infections like SARS and HDN1. Yet, I found no models predicting or giving confidence intervals for the spread of coronavirus. I wonder if the the data is still too sparse, e.g. we don't know if it's seasonal (mentioned in the above thread) and we cannot infer the virulence.

Would such a model be reliable? If not, how many months of data would we need to reliably use a model predicting the spread?
",11637,"The original R0 calculation was developed in the early 1900s to model malaria transmission and is known as the Ross-MacDonald model so your idea is over 100 years old. The model was very famous for identifying the optimal strategy for malarial control by targeting the adult mosquito rather than the mosquito larvae. What it said was reducing the mosquito population and reducing malaria transmission were two different issues. So the bednet strategy is based in this idea and particularly spraying the inside of houses with insecticide.

R0 was famously used in the 1980s to predict the HIV pandemic when WHO thought it would remain localised in Africa. 

The problem with R0 and Coronaviruses is we don't know the asymptomatic population who could also transmit the virus. 

This population is potentially very large. Epidemiologists will attempt extrapolation from cruise ship quarrentine, eg the Diamond Princess where everyone is tested to understand this transmission parameter and project this onto the rest of the planet. Clearly this could have limitations or inaccuracies. The other issue I am baffled by is seasonal transmission and whether this will occur with COVID-19. 

One thing R0 of COVID-19 will identify is the latent period transmission which occurs before the symptoms, i.e. the incubation period. Essentially, people with cough/mild symptoms before they self isolate and become really ill with a lung infection will transmit the virus. In this context R0 will be/was very influential for understanding when to move between quarrentine and containment phases of the pandemic.

  While the analyses above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2
  with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the
  interaction is not ideal and that the RBD sequence is different from
  those shown in SARS-CoV to be optimal for receptor binding.


The interaction with ACE2 is taking place on the Spike protein (S) in both COVID-19 and SARS-Cov. The S protein is very different between COVID-19 and SARS both in terms of sequence and COVID-19 includes an additional furin cleavage site, meaning structurally it is quite distinct. The ""computational analysis predicts"" is difficult because there is no crystal structure for COVID-19 S protein therefore modelling ligand binding is essentially guess work, particularly as it comprises an additional (furin) cleaved domain. What the authors appear to conclude is that they cannot map ACE2-Spike binding of COVID-19 using an established SARS S protein structure. I assume they are homology modelling SARS-CoV onto COVID-19 S protein sequence data.  In my personal opinion there is no way to homology model an additional furin protease cleavage site (furin is a host protease) so it would be difficult for ""good fit"" to occur, but it is just my opinion and the authors may have established methods to overcome this notable limitation, e.g. similar phenomena occur in influenza. 


  Thus, the high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to
  human ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection..


Their conclusion of ""natural selection"" is not strictly accurate and should be ""Darwinian positive selection"", but its a small issue. What they are saying is Darwinian adaptation has occurred as opposed to ""purifying selection, i.e. conservation. Thus they are definitely excluding human intervention because that is not ""natural selection""

They appear to be saying that if a synthetic virus was constructed it would be created using an established reverse genetics system, and all those produced to date look nothing like COVID-19.

The phylogenetics argument is always a stronger argument than either of the above (although my opinion isn't entirely objective).

Question: Why does the Wuhan coronavirus genome end in 33 a's?
",11229,"Good observation! The 3' poly(A) tail is actually a very common feature of positive-strand RNA viruses, including coronaviruses and picornaviruses.

For coronaviruses in particular, we know that the poly(A) tail is required for replication, functioning in conjunction with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) as a cis-acting signal for negative strand synthesis and attachment to the ribosome during translation. Mutants lacking the poly(A) tail are severely compromised in replication. Jeannie Spagnolo and Brenda Hogue report:


  The 3′ poly (A) tail plays an important, but as yet undefined role in Coronavirus genome replication. To further examine the requirement for the Coronavirus poly(A) tail, we created truncated poly(A) mutant defective interfering (DI) RNAs and observed the effects on replication. Bovine Coronavirus (BCV) and mouse hepatitis Coronavirus A59 (MHV-A59) DI RNAs with tails of 5 or 10 A residues were replicated, albeit at delayed kinetics as compared to DI RNAs with wild type tail lengths (>50 A residues). A BCV DI RNA lacking a poly(A) tail was unable to replicate; however, a MHV DI lacking a tail did replicate following multiple virus passages. Poly(A) tail extension/repair was concurrent with robust replication of the tail mutants. Binding of the host factor poly(A)- binding protein (PABP) appeared to correlate with the ability of DI RNAs to be replicated. Poly(A) tail mutants that were compromised for replication, or that were unable to replicate at all exhibited less in vitro PABP interaction. The data support the importance of the poly(A) tail in Coronavirus replication and further delineate the minimal requirements for viral genome propagation.

Yu-Hui Peng et al. also report that the length of the poly(A) tail is regulated during infection:


  Similar to eukaryotic mRNA, the positive-strand coronavirus genome of ~30 kilobases is 5’-capped and 3’-polyadenylated. It has been demonstrated that the length of the coronaviral poly(A) tail is not static but regulated during infection; however, little is known regarding the factors involved in coronaviral polyadenylation and its regulation. Here, we show that during infection, the level of coronavirus poly(A) tail lengthening depends on the initial length upon infection and that the minimum length to initiate lengthening may lie between 5 and 9 nucleotides. By mutagenesis analysis, it was found that (i) the hexamer AGUAAA and poly(A) tail are two important elements responsible for synthesis of the coronavirus poly(A) tail and may function in concert to accomplish polyadenylation and (ii) the function of the hexamer AGUAAA in coronaviral polyadenylation is position dependent. Based on these findings, we propose a process for how the coronaviral poly(A) tail is synthesized and undergoes variation. Our results provide the first genetic evidence to gain insight into coronaviral polyadenylation.

This builds upon prior work by Hung-Yi Wu et al, which showed that the coronaviral 3' poly(A) tail is approximately 65 nucleotides in length in both genomic and sgmRNAs at peak viral RNA synthesis, and also observed that the precise length varied throughout infection. Most interestingly, they report:


  Functional analyses of poly(A) tail length on specific viral RNA species, furthermore, revealed that translation, in vivo, of RNAs with the longer poly(A) tail was enhanced over those with the shorter poly(A). Although the mechanisms by which the tail lengths vary is unknown, experimental results together suggest that the length of the poly(A) and poly(U) tails is regulated. One potential function of regulated poly(A) tail length might be that for the coronavirus genome a longer poly(A) favors translation. The regulation of coronavirus translation by poly(A) tail length resembles that during embryonal development suggesting there may be mechanistic parallels.

It's also worth pointing out that poly(A) tails at the 3' end of RNA are not an unusual feature of viruses. Eukaryotic mRNA almost always contains poly(A) tails, which are added post-transcriptionally in a process known as polyadenylation. It should not therefore be surprising that positive-strand RNA viruses would have poly(A) tails as well. In eukaryotic mRNA, the central sequence motif for identifying a polyadenylation region is AAUAAA, identified way back in the 1970s, with more recent research confirming its ubiquity. Proudfoot 2011 is a nice review article on poly(A) signals in eukaryotic mRNA.

11250,"Ancestry of the coronavirus 2019-nCov, WuHan city, China","In one of the answers to another question about the corona virus a link was given to this phylogenetic analysis of the virus.

Can somebody assist a non-bio type here? It seems to show that the current corona virus split from a virus in bats. And that the same ancestral virus is also ancestral to several other viruses, some in humans and some in bats. 

Is my understanding basically correct?
",11268,"Overview
The central focus of the tree is to highlight the key biological concern of the new coronavirus, 2019-nCov. The key concern is the genetic similarities to SARS epidemic, and relates to the SARS receptor. 

SARS background SARS is endemic in bats (your BioRxiv tree partly shows that and this tree definitely shows it) and in the 2002 epidemic infected civet cats which then infected humans. More importantly it is then transmitted from one human to another. This is a consequence of the SARS receptor been able to exploit the cellular receptors in the respiratory tract of bats, civet cats and humans and use this tissue as a site of replication. The concern is exacerbated because the tree here shows SARS independently infected humans on two separate occasions, suggesting the cross-over has an underlying genetic basis, which is part of the ""SARS lineage"".

BioRxiv 2019-nCov tree Your tree shows the 2019-nCov has a recent common ancestor with SARS in comparison to the rest of the betacoronaviruses. This therefore provides some circumstantial evidence the receptor mechanism and ability to frequently crossover from bats and ultimately transmit human to human could be shared with SARS. At an evolutionary level (which is what ANY tree is supposed to reconstruct) it raises the question which common ancestor of SARS did the ""SARS receptor"" originate. I'd need to draw a diagram to better demonstrate this point, but I hope you get the idea.

The ""influenza receptor"" The analogy is with influenza virus and the entire epidemiology of influenza hinges around is sialic acid receptor of influenza and its ability to bind on to the cellular receptors in the upper/lower respiratory tract of birds, pigs and humans. The hypothesised mechanism is called the mixing vessel theory and is the classic epidemiological understanding of how new pathogenic influenza pandemics occur. If you replace ""birds and pigs"" with e.g. ""bats, civet cats and humans"" you get the idea why this could be scary. We don't the intemediate host of 2019-nCov ... but I speculate there must be one, unless eating Cov-infected bats is common in China.

Technical details of the BioRxiv tree The tree is a nicely diverse selection of the beta-coronaviruses. The authors have rooted the tree using the outgroups of delacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses, so it is a good robust selection of outgroups which can be used to correctly identify the direct of evolution of betacoronavirus divergence. In tree theory (its formal name is phylogenetics theory), extensive rooting is good and minimises artefacts.

One of the earliest members of the betacoronaviruses to diverge is MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome), which form a single ""clade"" (all viruses share a unique common ancestor) and these represent around 50% amino acid divergence from SARS/2019-nCov. The selection of MERS in the tree from both camels and humans looks good. The selection of other betacoronaviruses looks great, I wasn't aware of the ""ruminant clade""  at all involving buffalo, cow etc .. infections and there was an associated human infection. There are loads of bat isolates of the betacoronaviruses throughout the tree, but we eventually arrive at the ""SARS clade"". The authors show that 2019-nCov is an outgroup to the SARS clade and shows a close relationship to one (BioRxiv tree) or two (this tree) bat isolates. Looking at the precise SARS clade (better shown in this tree) we can see loads of bat virus associating with SARS lineages. We therefore assume the reservoir to SARS and likely 2019-nCov is bat, moreover that the single ancestor to both viruses was a bat (it is called a parsimonious hypothesis). 

The one thing the BioRXiv tree omits, for example with regards this tree, is the diversity of SARS and in particularly the two independent origins of SARS, which is a weakness of their analysis, particular if this fed into downstream analysis. It is not to say the authors were wrong, but it was uncool. 

Word of caution my understanding is the divergence between SARS and 2010-nCov is around 15% and this is a quite a large amount of genetic divergence, even if both viruses share a most recent common-ancestor, form part of the same clade and receptor peptide motifs. Nevertheless there is sufficient amino acid divergence to generate notable differences in epidemiology, clinical symptom and transmission. 

MERS, SARS and 2019-nCov mortality rates It is worth noting that within the betacoronaviruses the mortality rates between difference clinically important viruses is very different. MERS has a mortality rate of 40-60%, SARS is around 10% but 2019-nCov is &lt;2.5%. The 2019-nCov mortality rate is still important given it has infected more and could potentially infect alot more people than SARS.

  We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity/similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.

This is very odd, and will require a rigorous investigation, but my initial reaction is one of scepticism. Considering just the 1st insert, the insert sequence is GTNGTKR, short at just 7 amino acids. A simple BLASTP vs NR did not find perfect matches to HIV sequences, but did reveal 100% identity across the full sequence length to >50 other short protein sequences, which could be spurious 'chance' hits of course. Many of the top 100 hits are against eukaryotic sequences, for example one is against Pristionchus pacificus, a type of nematode worm (see alignment below). Someone needs to do a proper peer review of this preprint before any conclusions are drawn from it.

There are now 10 comments under the preprint, all of them critical of the idea that these inserts are meaningfully similar to HIV-1 sequences for the reason I outlined above (i.e. short sequences with many hits against organisms from across the tree of life) and additional points, such as small insertions being quite normal evolution for RNA viruses.

I have never seen such rapid (and unanimous) post-publication peer review before.

11301,Is it possible for coronavirus or SARS to be synthetic?,"I have heard several conspiracy theories regarding the origin of the new coronavirus, 2019-nCov. For example that the virus and/or SARS were produced in a laboratory or were some variant of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), shipped via laboratory workers. 

I am well aware bioinformatics has debunked many conspiracy theories involving infectious diseases, an important one being polio vaccination programs in Africa were the origin of HIV, for example here. Likewise, numerous conspiracy theories on the man-made origins of HIV were similarly overturned using bioinformatic studies.

Do you have bioinformatics evidence that would debunk the current conspiracists about coronaviruses?
",11306,"The scenarios are impossible and would be laughable if they were not so serious. The evidence is in the phylogenetic trees. Its a bit like a crime scene when the forensics team investigate. We've done enough crime-scenes often going to the site, collecting the pathogen, sequencing and then analysis - (usually neglected diseases) without any associated conspiracy theories. 

The key technical issue is coronaviruses are zoonoses , pathogens spread to humans from animal reservoirs and phylogenetic tree really helps understand the  how the virus is transmitted.

Trees 


The key thing about all the trees are bats. Bats lineages are present at every single point of the betacoronavirus phylogeny (tree), both as paraphyletic and monophyletic lineages, one example is this tree of betacoronaviruses here. Meaning the nodes connecting the branches of the tree to the ""master-branch"", represent common ancestors and these were almost certainly bat-borne cornaviruses. This is especially true for SARS and - here bat-viruses are EVERYWHERE. 
The tree here also shows that SARS arose on independently on two occassions, again surrounded by bat lineages and 2019-nCov has emerged separately at least once, again associated with bats. 
Finally the tree below is a figure from BioRxiv Zhou et al (2020) ""Discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin"" shows the 2019-nCov lineage is a direct descendent of a very closely virus isolated from a bat (RaTG13*). This is a really conclusive finding BTW.



Note, I don't normally present inline images, but it is such a nice finding (hint to reviewers) and BioRxiv is open access.

Conspiracy theory 1: laboratory made virus

Literally it would require someone passaging a new virus, with unknown human pathogenicity, and independently introducing all the earlier passages enmass across bat populations of China. They would then hope each lineage becomes an indepedent virus population before, then introducing the virus to humans. Thus when field teams of scientists go around using mist nets to trap the bats, buy them from markets, isolate the virus and sequence it they would find a beautiful, array of natural variation in the bat populations leading up to the human epidemics, that perfectly matches vast numbers of other viral zoonoses. Moreover, this would have to have happen substancially prior to SARS and 2019-nCov, because the bat betacoronaviruses have been known about prior both epidemics, viz. its simply not feasible.

Biological explanation
General Bats are a reservoir host to vast numbers of pathogens, particularly viruses, including many alphaviruses, flaviviruses, rabies virus and beleived to be important in ebolavirus (I don't know about this) and even important to several eukaryotic parasites. It makes sense, they are mammals, so evolutionary much closer to us than birds for example, with large dispersal potential and roost in 'overcrowded' areas enable rapid transmission between bats.

Technical
The trees show bats are the common ancestor of betacoronaviruses in particular for the lineage leading into the emergence of 2019-nCov and SARS, this is seen in this tree, this one and the tree above. The obvious explanation is the virus circulates endemically in bats and has jumped into humans. For SARS the intermediate host, or possible ""vector"" was civet cats. 

The theory and the observations fit into a seamless biological answer.

Conspiracy theory 2: Middle Eastern connection

I heard a very weird conspiracy theory attempting to connect MERS with 2019-nCov. The theory was elaborate and I don't think it is productive to describe here.

Biological explanation
All the trees of betacoronaviruses show MERS was one of the earliest viruses to diverge and is very distant from 2019-nCov, to the extent the theory is completely implausible. The homology between these viruses is 50%, so its either MERS or 2019-nCov. Its more extreme than mixing up yellow fever virus (mortality 40-80%) with West Nile virus (mortality &lt;&lt;0.1%), the two viruses are completely different at every level.

What about errors? Phylogeneticists can spot it a mile off. There are tell-tale phylogenetic signatures we pick up, but also we do this to assess 'rare' genetic phenomina. There is nothing 'rare' about the coronaviruses. The only anomaly is variation in the poly-A tail and that is the natural variation from in vitro time-series experiments. Basically we've looked at enough virses/parasites through trees, that have no conspiracy theories at all (often neglected diseases), and understand how natural variation operates - so a phylogenecist can shift the wheat from the chaff without really thinking about it.

Opinion
The conspiracy theories are deeply misplaced, and the only connection I can imagine is its China. However, the Chinese have loads of viruses, influenza in particular which causes major pandemics, but that is a consequence of their natural ecology (small-holder farming) allowing the virus to move between reservoir hosts. I've not visited small-hold farms in China, but I have in other parts of the world and when you see them, you get it. The pigs, chickens (ducks .. China), dogs, horses and humans all living within 10 meters of each other. 

Conclusion
Shipping large numbers of bats to market, bat soup, raw meat from arboreal (tree-living) mammals such as civets that are sympatric to bats. Then consider the classical epidemiology in light of the phylogenetic data, which is very consistent, a single picture emerges that coronavirus is one of many zoonoses which has managed to transmit between patients. 

Summary The fundamental point is the bioinformatics fit into the classical epidemiology of a zoonose.

*, Note The bat coronavirus RaTG13 predates the 2019-nCov outbreak by 7 years. It is not even clear whether the virus has been isolated, i.e. could just be a RNA sequence.

""They have found some 500 novel coronaviruses, about 50 of which fall relatively close to the SARS virus on the family tree, including RaTG13—it was fished out of a bat fecal sample they collected in 2013 from a cave in Moglang in Yunnan province.""

If the peaks are obvious and you trust your peak calling then sure you can just use that instead, but given that that's prone to error it's usually better to simply use normalized signal.

Regarding actually looking at occupancy, I don't think that's useful. Occupancy isn't binary. If you're instead wanting to associate peaks with genes then using the nearest gene is common (it's not great, but it's not terrible either).

CONFIRMED_DEATHS/CONFIRMED_INFECTIONS


However, given that there are only 2 possible outcomes; death or recovery, wouldn't it be more logical to use:

CONFIRMED_DEATHS/(CONFIRMED_DEATHS + CONFIRMED_RECOVERIES)


Which formula is applicable to which situations?
",11337,"This may not strike most as a bioinformatics, but getting the key clinical outcome is essential in understanding the molecular basis of pathogenicity.

I think the mortality rate is over-reported. This is not to say the situation of 2019-nCov is not serious - it is very serious.

The two essential factors missing in your equation for 2019-nCov are:


Age. Mortality is likely skewed towards the old and very young
Seroprevalence. To identify the number of asymptomatic patients.


Old people have a weakened immune system (e.g. reduced T-cell response). The very young have an underdeveloped immune system. The problem is hospital cases are skewed towards those with severe infection, which is likely the old and very young. In 2019-nCov the first infecteds were middle aged men, but likely to be restricted to those exposed to the ""Wuhan meat market"".

Problem 
Asymptomatic ""spreaders"" are known in influenza and are suspected in 2019-nCov. Asymptomatics will inflate the mortality rate (because we're not detecting them).

Solution(s)


One solution is to conduct seroprevalence surveys. Serological surveys screening for antibodies (IgG) against 2019-nCov will identify asymptomatic patients, using the first formula you stated. However, would you seriously go around the general population in a 2019-nCov epidemic taking blood samples? Errhhh no.
The bio-statistics approach is to use a catalytic model and critical to this is the age of the patient. Catalytic models are a priori models that incorporates the age-prevelance profile of infection. By introducing the incidence and age of hospitalisation of e.g. the old and the young, the rest of the distribution, i.e. asymptomatics can be calculated by regression. This estimates the total population of infecteds and again you use equation 1 to calculate the mortality rate recorded by the hospital.
Mathematical models based on transmission dynamics. The problem here is the rate of transmission is unknown.


I would assume the hospital is the place virus-induced mortality is reasonably accurate.

The second formula you described works very well for Ebolavirus, no-one has ever heard of asymptomatic Ebolavirus. It would also work well for another betacoronavirus Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome. The key problem with 2019-nCov is we don't know the number of asymptomatic patients or patients with such mild infections they never report illness. 

Summary
In summary, I think the mortality is being over-reported if it is based on your equation 2. Equation 1, however, will also over-report the mortality rate.

Coronavirus is an RNA virus, so I was expecting the sequence to consist of AUGC characters. But the letters here are ATGC, which looks like DNA!

I found a possible answer, that this is the sequence of a ""complementary DNA"". I read that


  The term cDNA is also used, typically in a bioinformatics context, to refer to an mRNA transcript's sequence, expressed as DNA bases (GCAT) rather than RNA bases (GCAU).


However, I don't believe this theory that I'm looking at a cDNA. If this were true, the end of the true mRNA sequence would be ...UCUUACUGUUUUUUUUUUUU, or a ""poly(U)"" tail. But I believe the coronavirus has a poly(A) tail.

I also found that the start of all highlighted genes begin with the sequence ATG. This is the DNA equivalent of the RNA start codon AUG.

So, I believe what I'm looking at is the true mRNA, in 5'→3' direction, but with all U converted to T.

The reason is simple, we never sequence directly from RNA because RNA is too unstable and easily degraded by RNase. Instead the genome is reverse transcribed, either by targeted reverse transcription or random amplification and thus converted to cDNA. cDNA is stable and is essentially reverse transcribed RNA.

The cDNA is either sequenced directly or further amplified by PCR and then sequenced. Hence the sequence we observe is the cDNA rather than RNA, thus we observe thymine rather than uracil and that is how it is reported.

https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/02/29/covid-19-is-now-in-50-countries-and-things-will-get-worse

The explanation is as follows
The course of an epidemic is shaped by a variable called the reproductive rate, or R. It represents, in effect, the number of further cases each new case will give rise to. If R is high, the number of newly infected people climbs quickly to a peak before, for want of new people to infect, starting to fall back again (see chart 2). If R is low the curve rises and falls more slowly, never reaching the same heights. With sars-cov-2 now spread around the world, the aim of public-health policy, whether at the city, national or global scale, is to flatten the curve, spreading the infections out over time.

I am having trouble with this. There are 2 curves here. First of all, I am not sure of the different processes that determine them. It says one is without measures. The other is with measures. But it also says one is with high R and the other with low R. Is R a fixed constant for a disease? Alternatively, is there some variability in R and does that degree of variation affect transmission? This is not explained or stated in the article and I haven't heard R described in this way. At best it is not written clearly in my opinion. 

In addition, does without measures necessarily imply high R? Is that what they are getting at? Also, it looks to me as though the blue graph goes to zero very quickly, basically when t is equal to the mean of the orange curve. That means that without measures the epidemic will end quickly (because it exhausts all the possible patients). 

Finally the areas under the two curves is about the same. This means that the number of patients is about the same with or without measures. 

Anyway, can anyone clear up any of this?
",11553,"R is a reference to R0, otherwise known as the basic reproductive rate, and means the number of new cases from a single patient infection. R0 has to be above 1 for a disease to persist. It is a classic equation which account for the probability of transmission against immunity. The y-axis is the number of infecteds, very poorly presented.

The idea is that R0 will be lower if there is containment (less people to infect because you can't move around), but will last longer, possibly because the number of naive patients (not encountered the virus) will be larger over a longer period of time. 

That particular graph appears to be saying that everyone at risk of infection will get infected with or without control measures (the surface area under the graphs is approximately the same*) and the only thing that will halt the virus is acquired immunity. If this is mainstream economic thinking then I beg to differ, albeit I note the source is CDC (again see note*). 

For example, all other respiratory viral infections are seasonal. If COVID-19  is seasonal containment is the right choice, because the window of transmission is limited.

*, Given this is of CDC origin I think either its a mistake, or at the very least was taken out of context, because the idea is that overall there is a lower number of people infected as a result of ""social distancing"" and that does not appear to be what the two curves show.
",Reasonable,"Early MinION sequencing runs had forward and reverse DNA templates joined together by a hairpin adapter, so that the sequencer would read both strands from the same template. The consensus sequence that was generated by combining the base calls of opposite strands is referred to as a 2D read.

Due to a dispute with Pacific Biosciences, and for other reasons related to chemistry and basecalling, the equivalent mode in current sequencing runs is called 1D². There is no physical ligation of forward and reverse templates, but the kit and flow cell chemistry are modified to encourage the reverse strand to follow the forward strand very soon afterwards through the pore, with the joining and consensus generation carried out in software after the sequencing is done. In the output fast5 files, these 1D² reads can also be referred to as 2D.

",11601,"There isn't a vaccine for any coronavirus, and your question is generally about targeted attentuation, which is a complex area. 

The basic building blocks for any vaccine development is virological understanding of the proteins involved in pathogenesis. I will focus on covid-19 as an example here.

The majority of bioinformatics work is based around the spike protein as is wetlab vaccine development. This gene is immediately after the 20 kb of ORF1ab, including the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, its around 3.5 kb but it might be a bit bigger. The spike protein is a major B-cell (antibody) antigenic determinant and the cellular receptor sites are located within it. Your bioinformatics could ultimately focus on targeting these specific sites, in particular using antigenic (antibody) prediction algorithms. 

First you need some basic biology of spike and hydrophobicity prediction is a good starting point such as TMHMM here and consider the SARS spike protein structure for example here. Once you've a handle on those structures antigenicity scanning would be a next phase analysis and possibly homology modelling. This is because COVID-19 and SARS are closely related, but there are key differences. You finally consider the full range of amino acid mutations in current epidemic via NCBI.

At this point you would target a specific vaccine design strategy and have a clearer understanding on the approach you wish to take. Good luck!

Finally, the interesting algorithmic developments for the link that I added to the question are described here.
",Reasonable,"Oligopeptide

The lipophilicity of an oligopeptide or a small molecule can be calculated with RDKit, the classic compChem python toolkit. The measure is logP or partition coefficient, namely the magnitude of the ratio of the concentration in octanol over than in water, so the higher it is, the more it partitions in the octanol phase. However, with a compound of several dalton it may be good to see what the contribution of each atom to this score are. This measure is the Crippen contribution to logP, which can be handily plotted on the molecule. Note that these are may be at first glance look similar to Gastaiger partial changes, but are not.

Okay, first the imports

from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import AllChem, Descriptors
from rdkit.Chem.Draw import SimilarityMaps


Now let's make the molecules. Let's start with something we can simply use a SMILES string of the web: Bortezomib.

name = 'Bortezomib'
mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles('O=C(N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](B(O)O)CC(C)C)Cc1ccccc1)c2nccnc2')


Now we can do all the relevant calculations on the mol object:

print('logP', Descriptors.MolLogP(mol))
AllChem.Compute2DCoords(mol)
contribs = Chem.rdMolDescriptors._CalcCrippenContribs(mol)
fig = SimilarityMaps.GetSimilarityMapFromWeights(mol, [x for x,y in contribs], colorMap='BuPu', contourLines=10)
fig.savefig(name+'_crippen.png', bbox_inches='tight')


LogP=0.3


colorMap='BuPu' is the matplotlib colorscheme. I have no idea which work best, I have spent way too much time trying and I do not know. But with BuPu, white is hydrophilic, purple is hydrophobic.

Say the oligopeptide does not have a SMILES or we don't want to do it that way. Let's take β-Casomorphins 1–3:

name = 'β-Casomorphins 1–3'
mol = Chem.MolFromFASTA('YPF')
mol = AllChem.ReplaceSubstructs(mol,
                                Chem.MolFromSmiles('N'),
                                Chem.MolFromSmiles('[NH][OH]'),
                                replacementConnectionPoint=0)[0]


The result with the last block from before gives:

logP=1


Proteins

With protein, it is a lot harder. Membrane affinity of protein is dependent on their structure. In PyMOL you can use the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) to show the surface by charge. For transmembrane protein there is clear ring of hydrophobicity —CHARMM-GUI membrane builder and a variety of tools for example can guess where it is. For a membrane associated protein only one side will be hydrophobic with a tell-tell charged ring around it (e.g. DHR1 domain) and there are no hard and tested methods for that.

11251,"Interpretion of my coronavirus 2019-nCov, Wuhan, China BLAST tree?","This is the BLAST tree of the latest coronavirus out of China. It seems strange that there is so much divergence from all the other coronaviruses. Is this expected of new diseases?


",11258,"The  evolutionary related group (clade) of betacoronaviruses you have identified share an amino acid homology of 85% and include SARS. I know this from the underlying tree published on BioRxiv of a broader group of betacoronaviruses, i.e. your data is a defined subset of the betacoronaviruses which all share a unique, single common ancester.

Lets call this group the SARS clade.

You have performed a nucleotide blast and asked NCBI to produce a NJ tree using 2019-nCov as the reference. I can tell this by the colour coding and the scale bar at the bottom right hand corner shows the genetic distance involved is reasonably larger than 15% divergence by amino acid data. The scale bar represents the number of mutations per nucleotide. 

In summary, your tree is essentially a subset of the broader genetic diversity of the one published, but there is there is a rooting issue. 

In your tree, the majority of sequences are from the 2002 SARS epidemic and the virtually zero genetic distance between them is simply because it is a rapidly transmitted outbreak. I didn't realize that SARS has two independent origins both initially from bats. This is quite scary. 


2019-nCov is an outgroup within the 'SARS clade' hence it appears at the other side of the tree, i.e. they share a more distant common ancestor
However 2019-nCov is not the most distant common ancester within this subset of the betacoronaviruses, i.e. SARS clade, this belongs to the two bat viruses ZC45 and ZX21. The program has made a likely rooting error (below).
Again the blast omitted the majority of the betacoronaviruses, for example MERS


Rooting issue the reason I suggest there is a rooting error is because the BioRxiv tree using a broad sample of the betacoronaviruses placed the bat strains ZC45 and ZX21 as outgroups to the SARS clade and 2019-nCOV was immediately within that, so in this definition 2019-nCOV is an 'ingroup' within the SARS clade, whereas your tree it is an 'outgroup'. It not a huge issue, but the location of the ""root"" is determined by the common ancester above it (sequences with &lt;85% homology) and in your tree those have been omitted. 

Generally, I like the analysis otherwise and gives an insight into SARS that I hadn't previosly been aware of.

I know this is a very broad question, but I am looking for the biggest common denominators. Said differently, if you could pick a few operations / algorithms / data structures to speed up Covid-19 research and they would magically run 1000 times faster, what would they be?

Note: links to books, papers, and scientific literature are very welcomed.
",12777,"I can only speak of drug design (and even then I am terrible at turning down the jargon).

In the case of drug design, this is pretty much plan C. Namely, none of compounds that entered clinical trial at the start of the year work (let's call this plan A) and none of the vaccines that are entering now clinical trial work (let's call this plan B although vaccination prevents so is a better solution). Clinical trials take a lot time as they need to be thorough (cf. the infamous thalidomide from the days with more lax testing)

There are several bottlenecks in drug design. These are technical based on our imperfect understanding of things, which results in less than ideal models. CPU time is not really an issue. Empirical validation is required at many steps along the way. This is greatly increased by automation. The XChem team at Diamond light source have done a fragment-screening against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease at an insane pace: things are changing fast!

Drug screen

There are many ways to make a drug. In one way, a test system was set up (a reporter assay) that gives you a measurable read-out, say mm of clearance of bacteria on a Petri dish (viability) around a cellulose dish soaked in different separated natural extracts —and you might find that Penicillium chrysogenum has a compound of interest. What you are doing is drug screen. Screening a large panel of compounds (of varying purity) does not necessarily require knowing the protein target.

Rational drug design

Fast forward to this decade and it becomes possible to predict the free energy release upon binding of a small molecule against a protein —mostly.

This requires a solved 3D structure of the protein by X-ray crystallography. Crystallising a protein is a tricky business, as a pure protein sample has to come out of solution in a folded form to form a neat lattice as opposed to just making unfolded gunk. What salt conditions work? Anyone's guess. Some have done deep learning on it, but the best solution is to have a robot try a very large range of combinations.

Once you have a protein structure you can predict what fits into the part that you want to target, say an active site or an interface. This is not done by simple cartesian geometric shape fitting like LEGO bricks as there are many molecular forces involved. So a mathematical model of these forces is made, called a force field. Many have been made, a lot of study has gone into these, but they are not perfect. It is all made worse by the fact that we cannot really model water properly —most models use a proxy (implicit solvent) or use non-polarisable water.
This is all while made worse by the fact that a protein is not static but wobbles (following the same mathematical models). So a ligand does not slot in really like a key in a lock, but has an induced fit. Modelling all this is accurately is problematic, but one can still try: calculating where exactly a ligand binds to a protein is called for which one gets energy difference upon binding. And one can try an inordinate amount of small molecules —Zinc DB contains 230 million purchasable compounds. This is called a virtual screen. One can even start with the natural substrate and ""weaponise it"" by adding chemical groups that do a chemical reaction that breaks the protein. However, a metabolite is very different from a drug (cf. Lipinski's rule of five) as the latter must cross membranes etc. But generally the accuracy is not great without multiple steps of empirical validation.

To improve the results from a virtual screen the most common approach is to do a fragment screen to guide it. This is to automatedly soak protein crystals with a large library of small compounds and see which crystal contains a bound hit. The hits can be expanded into bigger fragments in a virtual screens and the short list of compounds tested (these are not cheap) by soaking and crystallising again.
In the case of Covid19 virus, the cool thing is that this whole process is open in the aforementioned current campaign (Diamond is a government owned synchrotron and not a big pharma). What is really nice about this is that for the second cycle comp-chemists from everywhere have done their own guided virtual screen and have submit compounds (which you can see publicly).

It should be said that drug screens that are not rational design are still a thing. The recent antibiotic-discovering deep-learning paper in Cell]6 is such an example, although it should be said that it was a feat not only in AI but also in automated empirical testing.

Future

Automation via better and open software will definitely improve. With a small drive possibly from the dissemination of easy to use and to code off-the-shelf electronics, such as Rasperry Pis or Arduinos. But mainly with more complex machines such as the Opentron system (a python-controlled robot).

But indubitably where the greatest improvement can come is better mathematical models. Possibly even with deep learning. After all researches were amused last year-ish (2018 competition) when DeepMind ""won"" the protein 3D structure (fold) modelling competition (CASP13) and there have definitely been some really nice results in the field of docking with hybrid models. So deep-learning may still surprise us yet...

Lastly, open science will be a strong driver: using premade packages or tools on GitHub and code snippets from StackOverflow etc. will accelerate these.

49542,Lack of action taken by landlord against a noisy neighbor,"(First time posting on this SE, I hope it's not off-topic.)

I have a friend who lives in the Netherlands, let's call her Allison. Both her and her neighbor (let's call him Bob) live in an apartment complex owned by a therapy organization they are both patients at, and their landlord is also the owner of said organization. Bob has lived there longer than Allison.

Every once in a while (at least once a week, though sometimes a lot more often), Bob tends to be very noisy in his apartment, by listening to loud music or playing with a pinball machine (a physical, real life one, not a video game). This often also happens very late at night, which is obviously not allowed per contract, and the walls are incredibly thin. Allison has complained about this numerous times, as it prevents her from sleeping at night and her mental health is suffering because of it, which the therapy home was supposed to be helping with. The inhabitants of the other apartments don't hear any noise, as Allison's apartment is the only one that share's a wall with Bob's.

The problem: Since Bob is a therapy patient himself, the landlord and the therapists appear to be protective of him. Supposedly, he has his own baggage that prevents him from noticing, caring or remembering that he's being inconsiderate. While they don't explicitly condone him doing this at night, they barely take any direct action. Instead, they advised Allison to use earplugs, since the person who lived in her apartment before her never complained about this and they figured she may just be too sensitive. When the earplugs didn't help, they told her to message Bob whenever he's being too loud, because he apparently needs constant reminding that he's not supposed to do this after a certain time of day. Allison tried this, and it helped, but the silence usually only persists for a few minutes before being broken again.

On Allison's request, the landlord eventually agreed to order noise cancelling panels to be installed on the wall between their apartments. However, he only agreed to pay for the very cheapest ones available, which had to be shipped from China and are now being withheld due to the Corona virus. Furthermore, after it was clarified that these panels would need to be installed on Bob's side of the wall in order to have any effect, Bob suddenly expressed that he's not willing to put in the effort to do so. In other words, he refuses to actively do something to fix the problem he's causing, despite the panels being gifted to him (Allison has expressed willingness to invest into panels for her side of the wall out of her own pocket, just for added sound isolation, but as stated earlier, those won't do much on their own).

Recently, Allison's therapist started encouraging her to look for other apartments, all of which turned out to be substantially more expensive than her current one (given similar size and quality). Despite knowing that Allison's financial situation isn't the best, her therapist kept suggesting that it might be worth it to get some peaceful nights. Allison feels like this is rather unfair, like she's being punished for her neighbor breaking the contract and keeping her up at night, and that the landlord / therapy organization should put more effort into solving this for her, as the contract states that excessive noise at night is grounds for eviction. However, whenever she brings these arguments up, they keep getting dodged.

Allison tried contacting the police about this, but they dismissed her case as something that's out of their reach. They advised her to try something called a ""neighborhood mediation"", though Allison has strong doubts about the usefulness of such a thing, as the landlord and therapists have already tried mediating between the two of them.

Question: Is there any other way to resolve this issue? Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient's needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules? Is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one? And if not, how does one get him to take action?
",49557,"
  Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient's needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules? Is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one?


First, it is important for Allison to distinguish between the existing legal relations and each one's separate ramifications.

The therapist looks manipulative and dishonest when encouraging Allison to rent a more expensive place, since at this point it seems that the therapist knew or should have known that the situation involves the landlord (who coincidentally is the therapist's employer). At the very least, the therapist should have informed Allison that the therapist has a potential conflict of interest, and thus let Allison decide whether or not to rely on that organization's services. Here, the therapist failed to make due disclosure.

Instead, the therapist's acts have all the appearance of accommodating its other customer (Bob), and ultimately trying not to disrupt its employer's profits both as landlord and as therapy business owner. That conflict of interest sounds in therapist's malpractice and may even amount to [therapist's &amp; company's] fraud.

Regardless of whether Allison chooses to denounce the therapist and/or the business, she should ask herself whether a therapy organization with such practices is apt for continued treatment of --and the ensuing profits from-- Allison's therapy needs. One aspect Allison needs to consider is that her continued business there would weaken her arguments if she eventually brings court proceedings against the therapist or his employer.

Allison's tenancy is a separate issue. Allison knows better than I (and the public in general) the terms of her lease and the physical details of her residential unit, so only she can compare them with section 7.4.2 of the Burgerlijke Wetboek to assess whether the lack of quiet enjoyment is attributable to a defect of the leased property (article 7:204.2). Allison should assess this issue from the standpoint of landlord's possible allegation that """"the disturbance is caused by a third person"" (whereby the landlord would seek to avoid liability under 7:204.3). Depending on Allison's determination of the aforementioned issue, she would have a claim against the landlord for breach of contract, and/or against Bob for tortious conduct (6:162).

There are at least three reasons why Allison should follow the police's suggestion of neighborhood mediation. The first reason is that there has been essentially no mediation in Allison's dispute. Mediation requires a nonparty whose neutrality is not compromised when conducting the mediation. That has been missing here so far. Allison has only dealt with third parties (i.e., the landlord and therapists) who are first and foremost reluctant to inconvenience their noisy client Bob for fear of affecting their own business interests. Allison's belief that these people were conducting a form of mediation is mistaken.

The second reason is that, from mediation, Allison may pursue and obtain a written &amp; signed agreement whereby Bob promises to desist from his pattern of disturbances (ideally Allison would secure an akin sort of commitment also from the landlord). In the event that Allison subsequently needs to sue either or both of the parties for the continued disturbances, filing in court these binding documents (which she would have obtained through mediation) will ease Allison's burden of proof.

The third reason is that genuine mediation might obviate Allison's need to seek remedies in court. That is because it would teach both landlord and Bob that Allison is able and willing to take legal action if the situation persists or escalates, which might have a dissuading effect on them. Furthermore, mediation proceedings will give Allison some experience as to presenting her legal arguments in a more formal setting.

Courts in Netherlands may grant injunctive relief in situations like Allison's where the ongoing harm is not susceptible of being quantified in monetary terms. Allison may pursue that relief, which if granted would compel the police to enforce it each time Bob violates it.
",Accepted,"Arkansas does not appear to have its own version of the FMLA. Whether or not the FMLA applies to your friend's employer is a complex question related to other local businesses that may or may not be integrated with the franchise within which he works. It would require the knowledge of a local labor attorney and knowledge of the business structure of the franchisee to make a determination. 

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA - Department of Labor site) applies to employers with 50 or more employees within 75 miles of the employee's worksite.

Generally, franchise operations are independent businesses and the individual business would need to meet the employee count threshold for its employees to be covered.

However, there is the concept of an ""integrated employer."" The Labor Department sometimes groups smaller businesses as an integrated employer and this will cause the FMLA to apply to seemingly independent businesses with fewer than 50 employees.

The Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division lays out four factors to determine if the businesses are integrated:


  
  interrelation of operations, i.e., common offices, common record keeping, shared bank accounts and equipment;
  common management, common directors and boards;
  centralized control of labor relations and personnel, i.e., hire and fire employees; and,
  common ownership and financial control
  


They further state:


  A determination of whether or not separate entities are an integrated
  employer is not determined by the application of any single criterion,
  but rather the entire relationship is to be reviewed in its totality.
  All four criteria need not be present in all cases, but the Equal
  Employment Opportunity Commission, which administers the Civil Rights
  Act, considers the first three criteria to be the most important, with
  centralized control of labor relations to be most critical of these
  three.


A fast food franchise would not be subject to FMLA regulations because the franchisor is a large company. However, many fast food franchises are part of larger, local businesses such as restaurant groups that may be subject to the regulations.

An example of this would be Christopher Harold who owned Sofono, Inc, a company established to own three Domino's Pizza franchises. In Cousin v. Sofono, an employee sued to recognize that the FMLA applied to these businesses because they were an ""integrated employer."" There is an article in Business Management Daily that discusses the case and the appeal of the case can be found here.

Whether or not the fast food franchise where your friend works would qualify as an integrated employer with other fast food franchises is subject to an examination of the business structure of the individual employers. If the franchise is truly a stand-alone business with fewer than 50 employees then the FMLA would not apply. In the case of the Domino's pizza franchise they were deemed to be integrated because they were the same franchise licensees of the same franchisor (Domino's) and they had a common workers' comp policy.

Do be aware that the 50 employee limit is not a permanent employee threshold. From The Employer's Guide to The Family and Medical Leave Act:


  A private-sector employer is covered by the FMLA if it employs 50 or
  more employees in 20 or more workweeks in the current or previous
  calendar year.


The example they give in the guide is an employer that hires temporary, seasonal workers causing the employer to qualify under FMLA.

",49604,"Lawsuits are only allowed for harms to a particular private individual's health that actually arises from the conduct of the person sued. You can't sue because there was an outbreak in your city, you have to show individualized harm to you.

To prevail you would have to make out a ""negligence"" claim. The elements of this claim are (1) a duty, (2) that was breached, (3) by someone with injuries, (4) that were caused by the breach of duty.

There are two kinds of duties. One is the general duty to use the care of a reasonable person to prevent foreseeable harm to others (a breach of this duty is called ""negligence""). The other is to obey statutes and regulations and ordinances intended to protect people like the person injured from the harm suffered.

If someone doesn't violate a statute, regulation, or ordinance, then one has to show that it as negligent to carry out the event.

There would also be an affirmative defense that the fault was entirely that of the victim by attending the event knowing of the risk.

I wouldn't rule out negligence liability for event organizers, but it is more likely that they would be sued not for holding the event, but for failure to use reasonable care in how it was conducted (e.g. not having face masks and hand sanitizer on hand).

Some places, times and situations are riskier than others but there is always a risk in widespread travel. Outside of disease spread, there are other risks in travel; for example, if no-one traveled at all there would be no motor vehicle deaths.

On the flip-side, not traveling has its own dangers; for example, you will not die in a house fire if you are in your car.

Of course, there are enormous benefits to widespread travel;  economic, cultural and personal - life is to be experienced after all.

If you stop the skier from skiing, then you have just damaged the livelihood of all the people who depend on tourism; the airline, the hotel, the bartender, the ski technician, the baker in the ski resort etc.

Everything is allowed unless it is prohibited

By and large, this is the way that the law works. It's legal to do anything you like. Unless it isn't.

It isn't illegal to travel to, say, Finland. So you can.

If the government (of whichever country) decides that the costs of allowing people to travel to Finland now outweigh the benefits then they can prohibit it. However, that is a political decision; not a legal one.

As for your drink-driving example, I am old enough to remember when it wasn't illegal to drive drunk, although I was too young to drive. Of course, if you are in Somalia or Kenya it's still legal. Also, what counts a drunk varies by country - you can have a couple in Finland but cross over into Russia and you are breaking the law. Why does Finland allow such recklessness? Because it's a political decision and politicians in Finland and Russia have reached different conclusions about what level of risk is acceptable. Same with travel restrictions.

  The state of emergency is a crisis measure the state adopts in serious situations that considerably endanger people’s lives, health or property, or the country’s internal order and security
  
  It has also issued additional restrictions on social gatherings and other types of public activity.
  
  The State has also banned foreigners from 13 high-risk countries from entering the country, including neighbouring Germany and Austria, while Czechs are banned from visiting these countries, except for rescuers and drivers of delivery services.
  
  People will be allowed to cross the Czech borders with Germany and Austria only at selected crossings as of Friday midnight, with border checks being reintroduced, Interior Minister Jan Hamacek (Social Democrats, CSSD) said.
  
  The government has also stopped the issuance of Czech visas and acceptance of visa applications. No permits for Czech stay over 90 days will be issued, he said.
  
  Prague, March 12 (CTK) – All the passenger bus, train and ship transport to all neighbouring countries will be banned and air traffic will be reduced as of Saturday, the Czech Transport Ministry said after a government meeting today.
  It will only be possible to travel abroad by car.

  According to the Ministry of Health, anyone returning from Italy to the Czech Republic must stay in home quarantine for two weeks, with a 3-million CZK fine for violating the regulation. 
  
  Upon return contact your healthcare provider immediately — whether you are showing symptoms or not — to let them know. Your healthcare professional will work with health officials to determine if you need to be tested for COVID-19. 
  
  Reinforcing health measures at the Schengen Borders
  Under the Schengen Border Code, all decisions to refuse or accept entry to the territory of a Member State must be subject to an individual assessment undertaken by the competent authorities. It is the responsibility of the Member States to refuse entry on public health grounds to individual third country nationals.


Based on Czech and EU laws, no Czech judge should have any objections about these measures. 

From the comments:


  
    This requires some fairly specific government rulings to reduce travelling. A priori citizens are free to travel pretty much anywhere. If for example I travel within Germany to the most affected county and then back to a major metro area, one could argue that I'm not very responsible but unless either me or the county are officially quarantined, I'm not liable for anything.
  


In this case home quarantine for two weeks is mandatory and can be fined with € 115240,50. 

Any futher malicious activities (as done by the Japanese man, going out to deliberately ‘spread the virus’) by a person could lead to further civil and criminal charges (including liability for any cost or damages).

There is no need for you to ""consent"".

Consent is just one of the reasons that allows a data processor to collect your data. There are other reasons that allows the data processor to capture your data.

In this case, it seems of application the ""legitimate interest clause"", as it is in your university's legitimate interest to capture your activity in order to evaluate you.

Of course, that covers only the data collected that is relevant to that interest. They will certainly capture your identity and your answers, they may log your sessions and may try to gather some data to detect if you are somehow cheating, but they would not be allowed to check which are your favorite pornhub videos because that is not relevant for the university's legitimate interest.

Art. 6 of the GDPR states:


  Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
  (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
  (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
  (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
  (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
  (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
  (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

",Accepted,"In Canada as in the US, truth is a defence against defamation. Additionally, if the plaintiff makes the statement, then the defendant didn't, and the plaintiff would have no basis for pursuing a person who managed to get him to defame himself. If the people were to accuse the person of committing a crime (sex with a minor), then the potential for defamation exists, if that accusation was communicated to a third person (excluding police -- you can accuse a person to the police). In that case, the defendants might attempt to prove that the accusation was true, but I don't know how they would show that. If all they could do is prove that the guy acted kind of pervey but that actually accused him of having sex with a minor, then they would probably be in legal hot water. If they accuse him of doing what he actually did, that is not defamation. There is no law against getting a person to publicly admit to wrong-doing. ""Entrapment"" is something that only law enforcement can do (and it's illegal).

Since it is not illegal in Canada for a person to offer sex for money (it is illegal to be a customer, though), the youths are not doing anything illegal. In the US, though, that would be illegal, so they too might get in trouble.

It is highly likely that each state has a statute that grants broad powers to the governor in case of a state of emergency.

",50078,"Yes, GDPR applies:


you are a data controller established/living in the UK or are offering services to people in the UK
you fall under the material scope of the GDPR. The Art 2(2)(c) exemption for “purely personal or household activity” does not apply since you're offering the service to the public.


You must consider GDPR compliance here. This is especially important as you are showing personal data to the public. Don't do that unless you have a very good reason, appropriate safeguards, and are clear to users how their information will be shown.

On a high level, GDPR compliance involves working on the following questions:


For what purpose are you processing personal data?

Context: purpose limitation principle per GDPR Art 5(1)(b)
What is the legal basis for processing?

GDPR Art 6(1) lists the available legal bases. Here, consent, necessity for performance of a contract, or a legitimate interest could be a legal basis. They may have further obligations attached. A legitimate interest requires a balancing test that considers the data subject's rights and freedoms. Consent must fulfil the conditions per Art 7 in order to be valid.
What is the minimal data necessary to achieve the purpose?

Per the Art 5(1)(c) data minimisation principle, it is illegal to process personal data beyond what is necessary and adequate. You must provide data protection by design and by default per Art 25. Special categories of data per Art 9 such as health data are illegal to process outside of narrow exemptions. You must delete data once it is no longer necessary.
What appropriate safeguards and security measures should you apply?

Per Art 24 and 25, you are responsible for determining and implementing appropriate measures. This depends a lot on your specific context, so there's no checklist you can apply. Per Art 25(1) you must pseudonymize the processed information if that is compatible with the processing purpose.
What further compliance measures do you have to consider?

There are additional GDPR and non-GDPR compliance measures. From the GDPR side:


Use the answers to these questions to write a privacy policy, including the information that you must provide to data subjects per Art 13.
Consider whether you have to maintain a Records of Processing document per Art 30, or if you have to make a Data Protection Impact Assessment per Art 35. 
If you use third party services, figure out whether they are a joint controller or data processor and apply appropriate safeguards.
If you have data processors, ensure that you have a contract in place that covers the items from Art 28(3).
If you share data with other controllers (not processors) you need a legal basis for doing so.
If you transfer data into a non-EU/EEA country (after 2020: non-UK country) you need a legal basis per Art 44 and have to cover additional items in your privacy policy. Ideally, the target country is covered by an EC adequacy decision per Art 45. For US-based companies, this is the case only when they have self-certified under the Privacy Shield framework.


Non-GDPR compliance steps could include cookie consent banners, or showing a VAT ID.
How can you prepare for data subject requests?

Data subjects have various rights per Arts 15–23, subject to the modalities in Art 12. For example, a data subject could request that their information is erased from your website. The exact rights also depend on the legal basis you selected. You should figure out in advance how to deal with such requests.

A lawyer is considered an ""officer of the court"" in the sense that certain duties to the court are imposed on the lawyer. That does not give the lawyer authority as if the lawyer was part of the court staff, nor a law enforcement officer.

A statement can be prosecuted as perjury only if it is made under oath (or affirmation) in court, or if it is made ""under penalty of perjury"". This is generally done by a statement in a document signed, something like ""I declare under penalty of perjury that all statements in the above document are true to the best of my knowledge and belief."" It can also be done verbally, with the person making the statement agreeing that it is true and that this is subject to perjury prosecution if it is false. The exact wording will vary, but it must be clear and explicit.

Aside from that, false statements to a lawyer are not generally subject to prosecution for perjury, nor otherwise illegal. In some cases a lie in a business transaction may be fraud, which is actionable, and possibly criminal. But that will not have anything to do with whether the person lied to is or is not a lawyer.

This Wikipedia article says:


  Perjury is the intentional act of swearing a false oath or falsifying an affirmation to tell the truth, whether spoken or in writing, concerning matters material to an official proceeding.


...


  The rules for perjury also apply when a person has made a statement under penalty of perjury even if the person has not been sworn or affirmed as a witness before an appropriate official. An example is the US income tax return, which, by law, must be signed as true and correct under penalty of perjury  


The US Federal law on perjury, 18 U.S. Code § 1621 says:


  (1) having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true; or
  
  (2) in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;
  
  is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. This section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the United States.


Title 9 of the Maryland code, section 9-101 says:


  (a)  Prohibited.- A person may not willfully and falsely make an oath or affirmation as to a material fact: 
  
  (1) if the false swearing is perjury at common law; 
  
  (2) in an affidavit required by any state, federal, or local law; 
  
  (3) in an affidavit made to induce a court or officer to pass an account or claim; 
  
  (4) in an affidavit required by any state, federal, or local government or governmental official with legal authority to require the issuance of an affidavit; or 
  
  (5) in an affidavit or affirmation made under the Maryland Rules. 
  
  (b)  Penalty.- A person who violates this section is guilty of the misdemeanor of perjury and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 10 years.

It prohibits any gathering of more than two people in public and private spaces, except if they live in the same household.

What I am very unclear about is the extent to which certain behaviours are restricted by this regulation, as coverage in news is IMHO extremely unclear.

For instance, Berliner Morgenpost says:


  Gruppen feiernder Menschen auf öffentlichen Plätzen, in Wohnungen sowie privaten Einrichtungen sind angesichts der ernsten Lage in unserem Land inakzeptabel.

  Groups of partying people in public spaces, in apartments, as well as private facilities are inacceptable due to the serious situation in our country.

And Merkur.de says:

In English:


  ""Groups of celebrating people are inacceptable."", the politicians explained in unison. Any kind of celebrations are prohibited, this includes birthdays.


Now, what does this mean? At least some of the above statements can be interpreted in such a way that it's about the physically close group aspect. That is, celebrations whose participants meet in person in the same place are prohibited.

But then, all of those statements, and definitely the last one, also sound a lot like it's the very activity of celebrating that is prohibited, presumably because the ""serious situation in our country"" makes such a behaviour unbecoming. Thus, it sounds like restrictions similar to the Tanzverbot (that declare various overtly joyful activities to be unbecoming and thus unlawful on certain holidays) are in place.

Which interpretation is correct?


Am I violating the newly imposed restrictions if I meet with some of my friends (each of which is sitting at home alone, or at most with their families) via videochat and ""celebrate"" (whatever is meant by that, let's count any joyful or relaxing leisure activity) with them online to brace against the effects of social isolation and cabin fever?
And does it mean we cannot let our children have a joyful videochat with their friends whom they already cannot meet in person due to the closure of schools and child nurseries?

The actual decrees are much more specific and clear.

  (1) Events and gatherings are forbidden. Exempt are […]
  
  § 12 Gatherings and presence in public space
  
  (1) Congregations and gatherings of more than two persons in public are forbidden. Exempt from this are […]


Most of this is clearly about in-person meetings.
The only exception is the term “Veranstaltung” (event), which could be construed to cover online events.
However, in other laws using this term, it clearly refers to in-person events.

Force majeure does not change contract terms (e.g. making a non-refundable deposit refundable). Rather, it allows parties to get away with not performing their obligations where circumstances beyond their control prevent them from doing so.

In your situation, all parties have performed their obligations so far. You paid the required deposit, they welcome you on the 1st of April.

It would therefore be much more likely that they get away with not refunding you a refundable deposit (if there was one) because of COVID-19 — than you get back the non-refundable one.

50132,Can I sue my employer if they terminate my employment while I'm laid off during the Coronavirus outbreak?,"I am currently laid off from my job due to the Coronavirus outbreak. My employer informed my coworkers and I in a group meeting on the day before the lay-off that we would all be brought back to work when it is safe to do so.

If my employer was to not bring me back to work after the outbreak is over, perhaps citing a work performance issue or something along those lines, can I sue them for wrongful termination after they verbally promised all of us that we would all have our jobs after the Coronavirus outbreak is over?
",50134,"People are laid off all the time when sales are down, the market is bad, etc: there is no legal ""right to a job"" except whatever is in your employment contract. There is a legal concept of promissory estoppel which boils down to promises being binding. However, there has to be a clear and definite promise, not for example a statement like ""we hope to bring you back after this is over"". 

Normally, the employer can argue that they have the right to fire you regardless of performance, and that would be the end of it. Let's say you have it in writing, and it is clear that they unconditionally promise to hire you back: you would want to (e)stop them from arguing that they have the right to fire you. The underlying idea of promissory estoppel is that such a promise keeps them from making that argument. But: it is not enough that they made the promise, you also had to rely on the promise and act / forbear from acting in some way because of that promise. It could be, for example, taking another job, or moving to another country, or simply looking for another job. The hard part, then, would be getting a clear and definite promise.

  In the state of California, how could one find out if a commercial

The search is complex because there is no ""one-stop shop"" for this.

To search in federal court, go to pacer.gov.

To search in state trial court, contact the court of your county and ask whether it has a site for online case search. Other counties nearby might be using the same provider. For instance, the Washtenaw (in Michigan) county trial court gives public access to cases register of actions. Knowing that, it was easier for me to identify the analog for Wayne and Oakland counties. But Jackson county used a different provider. Likewise, California courts might be using Odyssey or other providers. There is no uniformity on this.

Keep in mind that an entity might have been involved in small claims court, which will not necessarily be reflected on the same site of county trial court.

To search for cases by party in California courts of appeal and supreme court, see here (the form to enter party appears after clicking on Search).

To search in the SCOTUS, see here.

Each court has its own policies for ordering records of the proceedings.

Leagle.com only displays decisions/opinions from appellate courts, supreme courts, and federal district courts. No litigation records are available from there. From personal experience as pro se litigant, I warn you that whatever you read in a court opinion does not necessarily reflect the actual evidence and arguments a party offered. Unfortunately, many courts are fond of distorting the record of a case for the sake of forcing an unlawful outcome.

Also beware that not all litigation happens in courts. A company could have gone through some Alternative Dispute Resolution method such as mediation or arbitration that might be of your interest nonetheless. Those proceedings would not be reflected in court sites unless at least one party escalates the issue (example: a party might appeal an arbitrator's ruling).

50305,"Does the ""Family First Coronavirus Response Act"" cover federal employees?","Apparently, a new coronavirus related paid family leave law takes effect on 04/01/2020. I understand that, among commercial companies, it applies only to those under 500 employees (because, of course, companies that can afford lobbying cannot be burdened, but that's unrelated to the question.) The questions I have regarding that law:

1) Does the new extended leave law apply to federal employees? More specifically, my wife works for Veterans' Affairs, and we'd like to figure out whether she qualifies. On one hand, VA has more than 500 employees, but on the other hand, VA is not a commercial company, and I don't see in the reports specifics regarding the government employees.

2) Would a mother of small children qualify for paid family leave to watch them while the schools are closed? This has become quite an issue as soon as the schools closed for the year.
",50311,"The Department of Labor has a page about the law.  Some excerpts (boldface mine):

However, federal employees covered by Title II of the Family and Medical Leave Act are covered by the paid sick leave provision. 


And as to your Question 2:


  Generally, the Act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for:
  
  Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay because the employee is unable to work because of a bona fide need to care for an individual subject to quarantine (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), or to care for a child (under 18 years of age) whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19, and/or the employee is experiencing a substantially similar condition as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor; and
  
  Up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay where an employee, who has been employed for at least 30 calendar days, is unable to work due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19.

",Accepted,"It doesn’t even apply to the airline in current circumstances


  (14) As under the Montreal Convention, obligations on operating air carriers should be limited or excluded in cases where an event has been caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken.


You don’t book with Expedia

Expedia is an aggregation service provider, they put you in touch with the supplier (who pays them) for you to book with. They are not a traditional travel agent acting as an intermediary.

So, no matter what, you can’t get your money from them.

What does the contract say?

We have already established that the regulation requiring a refund has excluded itself so the first thing to look at is your contract and why Air France cancelled the contract. They could have cancelled it because a government prohibited the flight, or because it was unsafe to make the flight, or because it was uneconomic, or ... 

As an added complication, you might have been prohibited from taking the flight even if it had been operated depending on your nationality and government restrictions at the time, if so, the cancellation of the flight has caused you no damage beyond that which you suffered from the government decree

The first step is to read your contract and find out who bears the risk for each of those eventualities and what has to be done. If the contract says you get a refund, you get a refund, if it says you get a credit, you get a credit. Ultimately, if there is a complete and utter failure of consideration, you are entitled to a refund - that is if they cannot provide you with a flight within a reasonable time. In theory, when this all ends, they could contact you and say, “we can fly you tomorrow” - they would then have fulfilled their obligation even if you don’t want to fly tomorrow. Legally, this is fine, commercially, it would be a disaster.

Force Majeure

This obscure area of contract law has become very relevant at this time. It means “superior force” and deals with what happens when a party is unable to fulfil its obligations under a contract through unforeseen in the contract and unforeseeable in practice events beyond either parties control. That is, between the parties, who took the risk of that unforeseeable event?

If the contract is silent then, under French (civil) law, Air France is relieved of its contractual obligations, that is, they are not in breach of their contract and are not subject to damage. However, if the contract is under Common (English/US etc.) law then they have breached their contract and owe you damages. Whose law is the contract under? You’ll have to read it.

Do Americans have a constitutional right to decline being tested and be allowed to pass through this checkpoint, or does a national crisis/emergency negate an American's constitutional rights and thus every person must comply with being tested?

EDIT

To help clarify my inquiry, what I particularly would like to know is if you are directed to exit your vehicle by a state trooper at this highway checkpoint so a doctor/nurse there can administer a test on you to see if you have COVID-19, can you decline to exit your vehicle and also decline undergoing this medical test? Do Americans have a Constitutional right to decline complying with such a directive?
",50343,"It is difficult to keep track of the rapidly changing legal variables, but it would be illegal and unconstitutional for state police to set up an unauthorized stop-and-search checkpoint on the road (""due process"" means ""following the law""). As a prelude, there would have to be some higher authority that empowers them to do this. You would have to scrutinize the emergency powers legislation of every state to be certain, but no governor has the power to mandate blanket body searches in case of a medical emergency. (Martial law shifts enforcement of the law to the military, but doesn't generally create arbitrary decree-writing powers).

The legal foundation of such searching would have to be a new law: then the question is what the law requires that could make on-the-road body searches constitutional. Since the right to be free of unreasonable searches is a fundamental constitutional right, this law would be reviewed under strict scrutiny. Searches ""just for fun"" will not pass such scrutiny, nor will ""because it's an emergency"" or ""keep the public safe"". Having the disease is not and cannot be a crime, so this law would have to be founded on a strict no-travel requirement. That brings the matter within the sphere of the ""officer safety"" exception in the case of an arrest. I'm not suggesting that an absolute travel ban would be upheld as constitutional in the US, but that is the kind of legal foundation that would be required for state police to force people to be Covid-searched.

  6.—(1) During the emergency period, no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse.


In this case, you would be relying on the reasonable excuse given in regulation 6(2)(b):


  (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), a reasonable excuse includes the need—[...]
  (b) to take exercise either alone or with other members of their household;


The regulations do not explicitly state:


how far you may travel for the purposes of exercise,
how long you may exercise for
even, in contrast with government advice, how many times a day you may leave your house for exercise.


It would require the interpretation of the courts to decide whether travelling for long distances was reasonable in order to take exercise, and whether exercising for many hours is reasonable. Michael Gove stated in an interview that:


  I would have thought that for most people, a walk of up to an hour, or a run of 30 minutes or a cycle ride of between that, depending on their level of fitness is appropriate.


This is of course not law, but opinion; yet it is worth keeping in mind that the courts may take a similar view to this.

A strong argument could be made to say that this scenario is not in fact necessary exercise, but leisure, which is not considered a reasonable excuse in the regulations. Equally, it could be argued that the regulations do support travel for exercise in any form. I don't think anyone could answer with certainty whether this is legal or not, until the law is tested on this point.

Given the threat of COVID-19, and how each infection increases the risk of future infections exponentially, the misinformation being spread could realistically put lives at risk.

Now I'm not suggesting anyone be punished for COVID-19 misinformation specifically, for many reasons.  However, it got me wondering at a more general level if there are forces in place to handle more direct and blatant spread of dangerous misinformation via the news.

It does make me wonder what laws exist for intentional spread of misinformation.  Slander and Libel laws only apply to misinformation about an individual, they wouldn't apply to other forms of misinformation.

What about more general misinformation?  If some news agency decides as an April fools joke to report that the government is encouraging all kids to play on highways today, or some other grossly negligent and potentially dangerous fact, and there is reasonable evidence to suggest it was done intentionally what laws may be used to penalize such a dangerous spread of misinformation?
",50494,"While the other two sort out their disagreement, here's one way the broadcast of misinformation is regulated which is not subject to dispute.

There is a federal agency called the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The FCC regulates interstate and international communications over TV, radio, satellite, cable, etc., throughout the US and its territories.  

Among its duties and powers, it prohibits the broadcast of false info regarding a crime or catastrophe if the broadcaster ""knows the information is false and will cause substantial 'public harm' if aired.""  FCC rules indicate that the harm ""must begin immediately and cause direct and actual damage to property or the health or safety of the general public; or divert law enforcement or public health and safety authorities from their duties."" 

Additionally, while law prohibits the FCC from engaging in censorship or otherwise infringing on First Amendment rights of the press, it is nonetheless illegal for ""broadcasters to intentionally distort the news, and the FCC may act on complaints if there is documented evidence of such behavior from persons with direct personal knowledge."" 

The FCC may not interfere with how a broadcaster chooses to select or present news or commentary and its authority to respond to complaints regarding the above is narrow in scope.  Generally, it cannot intervene without testimony from a person with ""direct personal knowledge of an intentional falsification of the news."" 

The FCC's authority for this may be found at 47 CFR § 73.1217, which states: 


  § 73.1217 Broadcast hoaxes. 
  No licensee or permittee of any broadcast
  station shall broadcast false information concerning a crime or a
  catastrophe if:
  
  (a) The licensee knows this information is false;
  
  (b) It is forseeable that broadcast of the information will cause
  substantial public harm, and
  
  (c) Broadcast of the information does in fact directly cause
  substantial public harm.
  
  Any programming accompanied by a disclaimer will be presumed not to
  pose foreseeable harm if the disclaimer clearly characterizes the
  program as a fiction and is presented in a way that is reasonable
  under the circumstances.


Important context is included in the accompanying note, which states: 


  For purposes of this rule, “public harm” must begin immediately, and
  cause direct and actual damage to property or to the health or safety
  of the general public, or diversion of law enforcement or other public
  health and safety authorities from their duties. The public harm will
  be deemed foreseeable if the licensee could expect with a significant
  degree of certainty that public harm would occur. A “crime” is any act
  or omission that makes the offender subject to criminal punishment by
  law. A “catastrophe” is a disaster or imminent disaster involving
  violent or sudden event affecting the public.

50495,What is the most effective way to contest poorly enforced speed restrictions?,"I live in a fairly desirable area with one drawback: my apartment overlooks a multi-lane restricted access parkway. I'd prefer not to say more for privacy reasons. Until recently, it's been only a minor annoyance.

But since things have been locked down due to the coronavirus outbreak, I've been spending a lot more time at home, and the traffic on the parkway has gotten lighter, meaning that at least anecdotally speeds have increased. The result is a huge increase in infrasound. It's like my whole apartment is shaking all day.

I'm obviously not expecting the state to shut down traffic on the road completely for my comfort. It does seem like a reasonable expectation that the people driving on a roadway should get at least close to the legal speed limit, however. The posted speed on the road is 30 miles per hour, while drivers routinely flout this going 60 or 70 miles per hour.

I've already tried writing to my city government, who referred me to a state agency who hasn't written back. I've also contacted the person who represents me in my state legislature. His office too has not written back to me.

On top of that, get as many people as you can to support your cause. The more noise they make, the harder it is for the government to ignore the problem. Circulate petitions, make calls, etc.

At the same time, keep in mind that this problem is a side effect of an emergency situation that is causing all sorts of problems that make yours look trivial by comparison.

Many infected people have been isolated to prevent the spread of the virus. However, medical resources are highly deficient in serious regions, leaving many patients untreated (or badly treated). Under this circumstance, is it just to isolate them?
",49215,"Questions about whether a certain action is ""just"" tend to be maters of opinion, politics and philosophy, but it can be addressed from the perspective of legal theory (especially following the model of common law, where legal principles are based on concepts of just and proper action). Whether or not a certain action is actually legal in a certain jurisdiction depends on the laws of that country -- I suspect that the answer is different for the US versus China.

The first question would be whether those government officials have the legal authority – I assume they do. Such authority is generally governed by some specific circumstances, for example, ""poses an imminent and grave threat to public health"". It is basically not a legal question whether quarantining in the face of this viral threat is necessary from a public health perspective, that is a medical question. What the law would say is that if this is a serious threat, then a person's liberty can be curtailed to a limited extent, because a person does not have the right to harm others because they don't want to do some thing that protects the rights of others (be vaccinated, stay in quarantine until it is safe). However, principles of legal justice also say that the government's response should be proportionate, e.g. shoot-on-sight in response to a sneeze is not proportionate. 

Quarantining has long been recognized as a valid, just and legal response to such extreme medical threats. Historically speaking, quarantining used to be the only effective action that a government can take against e.g. smallpox, plague, Spanish flu, Ebola.

  How is banning such events constitutional with the freedom of
  assembly?


The rights created by the First Amendment are not absolute. They are subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place and manner, especially if those restrictions are content neutral. 

Restrictions narrowly tailored to protect against genuine threats public health and safety fall within the exception of the First Amendment even if they are not strictly content neutral, that is commonly described by the rubric that you don't have a right to falsely cry ""fire"" in a crowded theater (causing a riot that could harm people). 

For example, suppose that a rope bridge over a deep gorge can only support the weight of ten people, and three dozen people want to hold a protest there. A regulation that prohibited more than ten people from engaging in the protest would be constitutional.

Even then, however, a lack of content neutrality (e.g., restricting punishment to false statements likely to incite a riot) can't also be a lack of ideological neutrality (e.g. restricting punishment to anti-Catholic but not anti-Jewish statements likely to incite a riot).


  If it were a political protest/gathering would this change?


Generally speaking political protest/gatherings are still subject to content neutral regulations of time, place or manner, and those narrowly tailored to protect genuine threats public health and safety.

So, for example, if there is a genuine COVID-19 risk that public health officials are trying to address, and the regulation of gatherings is not viewpoint or content based, it would be upheld as constitutional in the face of a First Amendment freedom of assembly limitation.

But, if the regulation applied, for example, only to Republican and not Democratic party protests or gatherings, which is a viewpoint or content based restriction, it would not survive a First Amendment freedom of assembly challenge. 
",Reasonable,"A government ban on all gatherings of more than 10 people in the context of minimizing damage from a pandemic is something that is quite understandable.

The current decree from many states ""banning"" gatherings/movement of 10 or more people, on the face of it, effects the same thing as say Stalin's dictatorial orders prohibiting gatherings/movement of people within the former Soviet Union.  

Whilst people should isolate themselves and limit gatherings until the pandemic is over, is this something that might be better framed as a ""request"" by the governor(s)?

Yes, governments have the broad authority to enact laws.  The US prohibits  and regulates pathogen experimentation (self-infection). There are also rules regarding shipping and export (ITAR).  Furthermore, in the US, there are (FL, NY state) laws that prevent patients from being tested unless the order is given by an authorized health care professional.  Hopefully, you do live in a state that does not have this regulation (AZ).

While I do believe in one's right to do as one sees fit with one's own body, there is the counter-argument: there must be limits when it comes to unnecessarily exposing the community to pathogen risk.  I hope that this question is theoretical and that nobody actually believes the immunity supposition without a credible peer-reviewed scientific publication.  Unfortunately we live in an age where misinformation is propagated at novel speed and scale.

I wish the OP well.  That being said, I have concerns regarding the underlying assumptions of the question.  While I am comfortable with the OP question, the underlying assumptions give me great pause.

UPDATE

IMHO: I hope that no reader will seriously consider amateur experimentation in self-infection in the hope of conferring immunity. Giving a pathogen uncontrolled safe-haven to propagate and possibly infect others seems irresponsible.

I doubt that the government cares if any individual manages to puts themselves in an early grave, however, it does care if amateurs create an unnecessary pandemic risk.   I would think that any government would view pathogen experimentation much like nuclear device experimentation, because of the mass casualty risk.  I hope that readers understand the implications of an amateur uncontrolled experiment.

  The Secretary shall, in the year 1980 and every 10 years thereafter, take a decennial census of population as of the first day of April of such year....


This requires that the census seek data describing the population on April 1, 2020.  It does not require that census workers actually visit people on that day.

This gives a short overview of the compensation rights of people who feel that their property (in general, not just a motor vehicle) has been unfairly damaged in a search.


  Constituents sometimes ask whether they can get compensation for damage (for example to a front door) following forced entry by the police. Police forces do sometimes make ex gratia payments or pay compensation following such damage, for example where the raid was at the wrong premises. However, statutory guidance states that compensation for such damage is “unlikely to be appropriate if the search was lawful, and the force used can be shown to be reasonable, proportionate and necessary to effect entry.” Where a police force refuses to make such a payment, then a constituent wishing to pursue the matter further would need to obtain specialist legal advice.


However, if a person wishes to press the issue, s/he can always sue the police.


  The Police Powers page on the Citizen’s Advice website gives the following very general information about suing the police:
  
  
    If your complaint is serious, you may wish to sue the police. You can sue the police in the same way that you can sue members of the public. If you want to sue the police, you should talk to a specialist solicitor.
  


United States

42 U.S.C. § 1983 sets forth some parameters for suing law enforcement officials.


  Under Section 1983 damages can take the form of nominal damages, compensatory damages and punitive damages.
  
  
  Compensatory Damages may include lost earnings, loss of earning capacity, out of pocket expenses, pain/suffering, mental anguish and emotional distress suffered. There is no inherent “value” in constitutional rights. Damage awards for 1983 actions, separate and aside from normal tort standards, may not be based on the abstract “value” or “importance of constitutional rights"" There may, however, be inferred damages, which arise in situations where the circumstances themselves surrounding the violation imply actual damages.
  Punitive Damages may be assessed when the defendant’s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected right. Punitive damages may be found even when the underlying threshold for liability is recklessness. Municipalities are immune from punitive damages.
  Injunctive Relief may be awarded.
  Nominal Damages may be awarded by the jury if they determine that the plaintiff's Constitutional rights were violated but they do not believe that they suffered substantive damages.
  


However, the person must prove that their rights have been explicitly violated. This is often difficult to do.

Two cases of interest are Cody v. Mello and Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents. The latter has been widely used alongside 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to support the idea that people can be compensated for damages.

In any case, to gain damages, a person must bring a civil suit to court. It may or may not be successful, depending on the circumstances.

Force majeure does not change contract terms (e.g. making a non-refundable deposit refundable). Rather, it allows parties to get away with not performing their obligations where circumstances beyond their control prevent them from doing so.

In your situation, all parties have performed their obligations so far. You paid the required deposit, they welcome you on the 1st of April.

It would therefore be much more likely that they get away with not refunding you a refundable deposit (if there was one) because of COVID-19 — than you get back the non-refundable one.

Assuming that the landlord is ready, willing and able to give you access to the property then they have fulfilled their contractual obligation regardless of if you can move in on that date. The apartment is available for your use; it's not your landlord's problem that you can't use it.

It would appear that there are two contracts here: the one where you paid the holding deposit in return for them holding it - this contract would appear to be complete. If you choose not to follow through with the second contract - actually leasing the premises; then that would not affect the contract that has already happened.

The concept of Force Majeure is not applicable here: both parties appear to be able to fulfill their contractual obligations even if you are quarantined - them to have the apartment available, you to pay the rent. The fact that you can't get the benefit of the contract is not a Force Majeure event.

50118,What effect does an event like the current Covid-19 pandemic have on contractural obligations?,"Across the world, the current pandemic, and various government responses to it will impact on parties abilities to perform their obligations under a contract. 

What are the legal implications of this?
",50119,"Force Majeure

An event like the current Covid-19 event is what is known as a force majeure event; a Latin term meaning ""superior force"". It refers to an event that is beyond the control of the parties to a contract such as war, civil disturbance, acts of God and disease.

Common law jurisdictions

In common law jurisdictions (most of the English-speaking world), force majeure is not a legal doctrine but a creature of the particular contract. That is, the extent to which a contract does or doesn't deal with such events is the extent to which such events apply to that particular contract. For example, a construction contract may specify that a contractor is responsible for the care, protection and reinstatement of the works unless damage is caused by war. So, if the damage is caused by war the principal bears the risk but if it's caused by, say, flood, the contractor bears the risk.

If a contract is silent on the matter (in general or in the specific) then the parties obligations remain unchanged by the event and failure to comply is a breach of contract. For example, absent a provision in a contract, in the current pandemic:


if a supplier is contracted to supply a component that was made in a foreign country and that cannot now be sourced from there; they will be in breach of their contract if they do not supply it. If it can be sourced from a local manufacturer at twice the price of the foreign source then that is the contractor's loss.
if a company is contracted to provide engineering services and their staff cannot travel (either because they are sick or because of government restrictions) then they will be in breach of their contract and the principal can seek damages.
if a construction contractor is obliged to finish by a given date and the government closes all construction sites, they will be in breach if they do not complete by that date notwithstanding.


These may seem to be unjust outcomes but, at the end of the day, somebody in the contract has to carry the cost of force majeure events and the development of the common law has left it for the parties to decide who. That is, at the time of negotiating the contract, the law allows that if the parties wanted to consider the risks of say, a pandemic, and spell out whose risk that was, they were free to do so and if they didn't that's their own fault - in the absence of such allocation, the parties must do what the contract says they must do. Common law jurisdictions have traditionally not seen it as the role of government to interfere in the details of private contracts.

Common law has a much narrower doctrine of frustration but this requires that the principal purpose of the contract be impossible to perform, not merely harder or more expensive to perform. Even much harder or much more expensive.

Civil law

In civil law jurisdictions (continental Europe with their ex-colonies and most of Asia), force majeure is a legal doctrine. 

It is a defence to liability where the defendant:


had nothing to do with the event - this pandemic would fit,
is unpredictable - it is not certain that the pandemic was unpredictable. There have been pandemics before and many organisations around the world exist specifically to respond to them. Lest this seems needlessly pedantic, there have been cases decided that because a flood occurred 69 years ago, this flood was predictable; similarly, an avalanche 50 years ago rendered this one predictable. If predictable, then the defendant is obliged to have prepared for it.
The consequences must have been unpreventable.


So, even though it exists in civil law it is not a get out of jail free card.

International law

The UNIDROIT Principles encompass force majeure as follows:


  Non-performance by a party is excused if that party proves that the non-performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences.

50184,Schengen Area: What was the legal rationale for countries extending Temporary Reintroduction of Border Control beyond Nov. 2017?,"(This is not about the coronavirus pandemic, which I understand is a different issue, but about the six countries that had already been maintaining border controls since related to migration and terrorism since 2016.)

Could someone explain to me the legal basis of Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway's extension of ""temporary reintroduction of border control"" declarations past the original 2-year deadline in November 2017? I'm trying to understand what the legal justification was for that, and I just keep getting more and more confused the more I read. Was the Commission's recommendation of September 2017 on extending the time frames adopted at some point? Or did they find some other loophole? 

I have found some media references to them ""switching to France's strategy"" (which I don't understand well either) or switching from Article 29 provisions to Article 25 provisions. But when I read the Schengen Borders Code, I can't find anything in Article 25 that I can manage to interpret as allowing unlimited extensions.

I understand that there's an argument that what these five countries and France have been doing is indeed illegal, but I want to also understand what their own lawyers' argument would be for its legality.

Thanks in advance!
",50545,"Regarding Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, details can be found on the Commission website. According to the table of all notifications, they all periodically invoke the “security  situation  in  Europe  and  threats  resulting from the continuous significant secondary movements”. This is obviously in blatant contradiction with article 25 but in practice that doesn't matter. You cannot find anything in there foreseeing unlimited extensions because there isn't. It's as simple as that, no sophisticated legal wizardry is involved (regarding the fate of Juncker's 2017 proposal: that limit hasn't changed since the current framework was introduced in 2013 and is still present in the June 2019 consolidated version of the Borders Code).

By contrast, France's strategy is to ignore the law entirely (as opposed to merely ignoring some specific clause of article 25): introduce quasi-systematic checks on some borders, don't try to create half-hearted legal justifications, don't notify the Commission or invoke some generic “persistent terrorist threat” applying to all borders and count on the Commission to carefully avoid challenging France on this. Back in 2015, the country suffered a string of deadly terrorist attacks and ultimately activated a state of emergency so that it had already invoked the right to reintroduce border controls and did not need any additional notification when the refugee crisis worsened.

The table on the Commission's website gives some additional insight into how all this came to pass. Back in 2015, many countries invoked article 28 with rather specific justifications related to the increasing number of refugees entering the Schengen area. After this initial unilateral move, the Council issued three recommendations to give these countries some legal cover (November 2016, February 2017, and May 2017) while roughly following the letter of article 25 (no more than six-month extension at once, not more than two years of border controls in total). Meanwhile, the Commission initiated a “Back to Schengen” strategy to try to salvage open borders in the Schengen area and make sure they appeared to be in charge.

But in reality, the countries in question were clearly intent on imposing checks no matter what, even if it was not possible to find some other face-saving legal basis. So when the last six-month period expired, they stopped being so specific and just reverted to a generic notification while everybody else turned a blind eye.

Note that the Commission does have a tool to enforce these rules and force a member state to, at the very least, make an effort to offer a more detailed legal rationale for its actions: infringement proceedings. For a long time, rules pertaining to the “Area of freedom, security and justice” were subject to different rules but since 2014, it falls under the ordinary EU law regime. The Commission has however been very shy in launching infringement proceedings on such a politically sensitive topic.

50295,Are Employers Obliged to let you Return to Work Early from Unpaid Leave?,"I have been an employee at the company for over 5-year and I had requested time off work (4-months) to do sabbatical with some travelling. It was granted by my line manager. The request was made in person and then finalised in email.

However, fast-forward to now and due to the coronavirus pandemic, I have had to return home early from my travels, at great financial cost. As such, I am keen to start working again as soon as possible and can do so from home with ease. FYI, before leaving I was working from home once a week anyway!

I having had a call with my line manager, he says it won't be possible to return before the original return date, almost 2-months away. I am certain that in any normal situation (e.g. sans corona) they would be pleased to have me back early. After all, there was a reluctance to let me go in the first place. When I pressed him on why, I was told my pay wasn't in the budget for April and due to corona they were already down in their P&amp;L.

However, the UK government is willing to reimburse companies pay 80% of people's wages if the coronavirus has stopped them from working, so this seems a weak reason.

Either way, this leaves me in a very strange situation: I am employee but I am not being payed.

Therefore my questions are as such:


Can my company legally stop me from returning to work, if it is not from something such as illness, etc? Alternatively, there is a mechanism in place that can allow me to return to work earlier?
If I am not allowed to return to work, what does this mean for my employment status? If I was unemployed I could claim certain benefits, however, I would consider myself employed so I feel rather in limbo right now!


Any advice on this would be REALLY appreciated.

TL;DR


I requested 4-months leave
I have asked to start again 2-months
early
I am being denied that
Do I have a right to start again early?/Are they obligated to allow me to return early?




Outcome

It seems that I am in a rather strange, but probably not entirely unique position, so I will detail some findings for those that might find them useful.

My employment status remains ""Employed"", as suggested in the answers. However, I wrongly assumed this excludes me from claiming Universal Credits. As I am not current earning I can still apply (in fact you can apply if you are earning, that just take this into accounts and give you less). Hopefully this is useful to someone else in my position.
",50298,"No, they are not obliged to take you back early

As you say in your TL;DR you arranged 4 months leave and your employer no doubt made arrangements to deal with your absence. Now, you want to return early; they are not obliged to allow you to do so just as you would not be obliged to do so if they wanted you to cut your leave short.

No doubt the current pandemic has changed the situation and in its absence, they might have been more willing to have you back early. But then, you wouldn't want to be coming back early.

Your employment status is that you are employed and on leave. Subject to the details of your employment contract; there is nothing stopping you taking another job - there is a huge demand for logistics workers particularly in the health sector at the moment; much of it unskilled work. dIf you want to be unemployed, you can always resign.

",50533,"Redundancy is a form of dismissal from employment — in other words, a permanent end to your employment. This is usually done if an employer needs to downsize, or if the job that you are employed for no longer exists. For example, if A runs a factory and decides to close it, the employees of that factory would likely be redundant. You are generally entitled to redundancy pay in this case.

In the UK, a lay off is asking an employee to stay at home or take unpaid leave when the employer does not have any work to give the employee. This is a temporary situation: your employment does not end, but you may not be paid as there is no work for you to do. A person who is laid off may be entitled to statutory guarantee pay.

A furlough is essentially the same thing as a lay off, although the term has become significantly more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government guidance states that


  If you and your employer both agree, your employer might be able to keep you on the payroll if they’re unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of coronavirus (COVID-19). This is known as being ‘on furlough’.


The government furlough scheme, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, has brought the term to greater attention, and this offers 80% of an employee's wages while they are under furlough.
",Reasonable,"This article summarizes a number of relevant cases. The underlying issue is that trademark protection does not give a person absolute ownership of certain words, it restricts how that may be used in a commercial context.

There is this thing called the ""Rogers test"", from Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994 which essentially says that in an expressive work, you can't use a trademark in a way that has ""no artistic relevance to the underlying work"" or if it ""explicitly misleads as to the source or the content"": that's a lesser restriction than the ""confusion"" test, which is the standard commercial speech test. (It must be pointed out that all of the test cases where ""fair use"" was found are in fact varieties of commercial speech, such as a movie, various publishing companies -- but the typical (?) social media use of hashtag is pure personal expression).

As for ""who decides"", well, The Law decides; this is embodied in a set of instructions read and somewhat selected by the judge and somewhat selected by his superiors; then the jurors try to understand what that means and apply it to the testimony, and answer a bunch of questions culminating in a verdict. And then is someone is unhappy, they can sue on some basis, so another bunch of judges get to make the final determination (or they could decide to avoid the case).

Thailand has been very popular with visitors for decades and if laws existed that discriminated against foreigners this would be commonly known. 

So in this case the 'discrimination' probably not because of citizenship, but more about a faulty assumption that the virus is spread by foreigners. This will have nothing to do with Thai law.

The (tweet) OP quotes only another persons claim. The OP states in the first tweet that they checked his passport only to see if he was abroad recently. So he didn't share the same experience of the American. Based on that, this second hand source (that can't be verified) is probably unreliable.

  At a bar beside the Trevi fountain, a notice was put up banning customers from China.
  


So the the situation described by the original (tweet)  OP is understandable, but the quoted (but not varified) second hand source as well as the events in Italy are not. 


  The incidents have prompted condemnation from the Italian authorities.
  Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte reprimanded the regional governors, telling them that they were not competent to make such a call and that nothing justified such fear.

Special cases may exist for prices that are subsidized and thus only for residents. 

Dual pricing was common in the Czech Republic until 1999, when it was ruled illegal (but still persisted). Then a foreign resident had to supply proof of residency to avoid paying the higher price. 2007: Illegal practice of dual pricing persists in Czech Republic 

At the time we assumed that this was legal (it was certainly understandable), but it seems that was not the case.

",Reasonable,"At a minimum, what the theater did was not a crime. When you are in a movie theater you have what is called a ""license"" from the theater to be present, which is revocable at will without due process (possibly subject to breach of contract damages) and not a property right to be in the theater the way that a tenant who must be evicted does.

As a practical matter, given that the amount in controversy is, at most, $25 or so, and this is not a situation where the prevailing party would get their attorneys' fees, this is not cost effective to litigate, regardless of who is correct, even in small claims court without an attorney.

Whether or not the theater breached its contract isn't perfectly clear, because usually, the contract between a movie goer and a movie theater is not spelled out in any writing provided to the movie goer, incorporated by reference in something disclosed to the movie goer, or signed by either of the parties, or even with an oral offer and acceptance setting forth all of the terms of the agreement. (Of course, if a written terms of service is actually provided to the movie goer, or a reference to where it can be found is provided to the movie goer, those terms will control and the contract will almost certainly be written to allow the movie theater to do what it did in this case.) In the frequent case where this is not done, the contract between a movie goer an a movie theater is usually a contract implied in fact whose terms at the edges aren't terribly well defined and there is little case law to tell us what the terms of the contract is, because the cases aren't worth litigating up to an appellate court where binding precedents are made.

Indeed, one reason that movie theaters may have declined to put their implied in fact contracts with movie goers in writing is to leave the situation ambiguous so as to discourage someone whose case would be clear even if for a small dollar amount, if the terms of the contact were clear, from suing them over issues like this one. When the stakes are small and the outcome is always uncertain, it almost never makes sense to sue.

There is certainly a colorable argument that you breached the contract by being present without an adult at an R-rating movie when the public statements about an R rating made available to the movie goers says that rated R means only admitted with a person over the age of 17, contrary to the theater's policies on that issue, although it isn't perfectly clear if this is a suggestion or a binding term of the agreement.

Another fair interpretation of the contract between a movie goer and the movie theater is that a movie goer can be removed from any movie whenever, if in the reasonable opinion of the movie theater management, good cause exists to do so, and that its discretion should be upheld so long as it acts in good faith and in a non-discriminatory manner.

I don't agree, however, that the question of whether or not you breached a contract was unambiguously clear, because the terms of the agreement are not well defined. I would give you at least a 20% chance of prevailing if you took the issue to court although I would agree that it is more likely than not that you would not prevail if you took the issue to court.

Force Majeure in English law only exists if it is detailed in the contract. There is no general legal concept like there is in civil law jurisdictions. Further, even if there was such a clause, it would need to capture Covid-19 within the definition of Force Majeure either by defining it sufficiently broadly or by naming “pandemics” a one type of Force Majeure event.

English law has the much narrower doctrine of frustration but that requires that the supervening event becomes impossible, not just more onerous or expensive. It doesn’t apply here.

It’s also possible for a contract to have a change of law clause - this would probably apply to Covid-19 since the proximate reason for your work stopping is likely a government regulation. However, these are generally worded to allow the payee to recover additional costs of complying with the law, not to reduce the payer’s obligations. Notwithstanding, I’m guessing that your contract doesn’t have one of these either.

In your case you are required to keep paying and the have the scaffold removed before the deadline or you will be in breach and liable for damages. Under the terms of your contract, you took the risk of pandemics even if you didn’t know you were.

How do you check whether the answer is at most $m$ in time $O(n)$? The idea is to slide a window of length $m$ across your array. If at some point all elements outside the window are distinct, then we are done.

How do we implement this sliding algorithm? Let $A$ be the original array. We initialize an array $M$ which contains the histogram of the elements in $A_{m+1},\ldots,A_n$, as well as the number of distinct elements $x$. If $x = n-m$ then we are done. Otherwise, we modify $M$ to contain the histogram of $A_1,A_{m+2},\ldots,A_n$:


We remove one copy of the element $A_{m+1}$ from $M$. If the new count of this element is $0$, then we decrease $x$.
We add one copy of the element $A_1$ to $M$. If the new count of this element is $1$, then we increase $x$.


In this way, we can update $M$ in time $O(1)$ per shift.

The solution you link to does all this, apart from maintaining $x$; this is done automatically by the C++ map data structure.

129151,aqueous solution recipe calculations: Using oxy-bleach as surface sanitizer [NOT A PERSONAL HEALTH QUESTION],"NOTE: Please do not delete this question.  It is not a personal health question.  The question has broad utility, in cases where others find themselves in social-distancing or quarantine with need for surface sanitizer, and their only available ingredients are water and powdered oxy-bleach.

I need a quantity of surface sanitizer to decontaminate boxes delivered to the house during the Coronavirus19 social-distancing period.  

CDC and WHO say 0.5% hydrogen peroxide solution will destroy coronavirus19.  And powdered oxy-bleach a.k.a. Sodium percarbonate contains 32.5% by weight of hydrogen peroxide, I'll call it roughly a third.

So to make a water solution of hydrogen peroxide using powdered oxy-bleach, I'm thinking I need to add enough powdered oxy-bleach (by weight) to equal 3 x 0.5% of the weight of the water. I.e, for a gallon of solution, 1.5% of 8.3 pounds, thus 0.12 lb, or ~2 oz.

A friend checked this and agreed, saying:
""A 0.5% H2O2 solution in water will consist of (per gallon): 0.42 lbs of H2O2 and 7.9 lbs of H2O. To get 0.42 lbs of H2O2 out of Oxy-bleach (32.5% H2O2), divide 0.42 by 0.325, which = 0.128 lbs or 2.0529230769 ounces...😁""

",129168,"Yes, do use household dilute H2O2 but, in general, do not use commercial percarbonates powders as they can contain an additive to convert the friendly percarbonate into more powerful Peracetic acid (PAA). The latter allows the otherwise weak bleaching power of the H2O2 to compete with chlorine-based bleaching. However, this comes at a price (safety). Hence, the dire warning labels, usually in at least two languages, on Oxi-Bleach and generic related products.

I quote myself on this subject:


  Sodium percarbonate is chemically just an addition compound of Na2CO3 and Hydrogen peroxide.
  
  Also, while Sodium carbonate and Sodium percarbonate (basically Na2CO3 and 3Na2CO3.2H2O2) are often listed as the main ingredients in typical chlorine free bleach, an additive, TAED, which acts as a key activator (see, for example) is not even listed on the label. TetraAcetylEthyleneDiamine is apparently commonly employed as a bleach activator in many laundry products (see this).  TAED reacts with H2O2 in alkaline conditions (referred to as perhydrolysis) creating, in part, Peracetic Acid. The latter PAA is actually preferred over sluggish H2O2 for bleaching. In other words, it is not the H2O2 as the active bleaching agent, but PAA created in situ.  So, other than possibly misleading implying that eco friendly hydrogen peroxide is the active agent, it is, in reality, PAA, a probematic compound with associated  health concerns (see Marquand, E. C.; et al. , 2007. ""Asthma Caused by Peracetic Acid-Hydrogen Peroxide Mixture"". J. Occup. Health. 49 (2): 155–158.). Here is a MSDS on an actual PAA mix ( 76-61% water, PAA 20-35%, 3% Acetic acid and 1% H2O2) available at which is far from friendly but does eventually totally decompose into harmless O2, CO2, H2O,...
  
  As such anyone using a commercial percarbonate product should at least be aware of safety issues and that one is likely employing a Peracetic acid mix.


However, such more powerful PAA based mixtures do have their use and is recommended by the U.S. Military as a chemical/biological warfare decontamination protocol (see ""Development of Bicarbonate-Activated Peroxide as a Chemical and Biological Warfare Agent Decontaminant""). So, it is up to the user to weigh the relative risks of the situation.
",Accepted,"TLDR: 

Mercury in its (+2) salts does not have lone pairs readily accessible for covalent bonding. However, its 5d electrons do affect its properties,  resulting in a relatively high polarisability.

The long story:

Mercury is the last 5d element and has electron configuration $[\ce{Xe}] 4f^{14} 5d^{10} 6s^2$. The $6s$ electrons are the outermost electrons and readily available for covalent bonding. $4f$ electrons are virtually inert since they are very deep. $5d$ electrons belong to the previous shell, but are the outermost of them and once mercury looses its $4s$ electrons, $5d$ electrons become the outermost and define its properties. They are still too strongly bound to the nucleus to participate in covalent bonds under ordinary conditions ($\ce{HgF4}$ was only observed spectroscopically in inert gas matrix). , but are far enough to wiggle around and participate in non-covalent interactions, such as van-der-waals interactions. $6p$ orbitals are also available for covalent bonding, though extent of their use is often debatable and/or unobvious.

I am saying that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be everywhere in the world. Why? Because, for example, dust is everywhere in the air and air is not static, i.e. ""it flies"" from one site to another and hence it can move to a place where no infected people have been at.

  In recent decades, drastic progress in solar fuel production has occurred: photovoltaic cells can generate electricity from the sunlight,[1−4] whereas photoelectrochemical [5] and photocatalytic [6−11] water splitting can directly produce hydrogen and oxygen by harvesting the sunlight. An electrolyzer can electrochemically split water molecules,[12,13] which can be conjugated with the photovoltaic cells.[14,15] Importantly, during the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic water splitting, what takes place on the surface is electrocatalysis, in association with the photonic processes at the bulk of photon absorber and the interface between the photon absorber and electrocatalyst.[11] Electrocatalysis will thus certainly play a crucial role in the solar fuel production process in the future. 


And further concentration-related statement taken from the abstract, where HER refers to the hydrogen evolution reaction:


  The choice of electrolyte in terms of its identity and activity drastically altered the HER performance. Electrolyte properties (activity coefficient, kinematic viscosity and diffusion coefficient) accurately described the mass-transport contribution, which was easily isolated when a highly active Pt catalyst was used. The HER rate on the Pt was maximized by tuning the solute concentration (typically 1.5 – 2.0 M). Moreover, the kinematic viscosity and oxygen solubility under such densely buffered conditions governed the oxygen mass-transport flux in the electrolyte, which in turn tuned the cross-over flux. At near-neutral pH, as high as 90% selectivity toward the HER was achieved even under an oxygen saturated condition, where only a 40 mV overpotential was needed to achieve 10 mA cm−2 for the HER. This information can be regarded as an important milestone for achieving a highly efficient water splitting system at near-neutral pH.

129022,222nm HARMLESS UV lamp for protecting from virus covid-19,"I did asked before , but apparently providing a link to a science report of harmless for humans (both skin and eyes) far-UV light was not enough to make people understand the significance of the solution to the raging COVID-19.
So this link (please read a bit of it):
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w
Says that the UV light of wavelength 222 nanometers (the photons bounces off the skin and the eyes) is absolutely harmless and do not make neither skin cancer or cataract. So this light is deadly for viruses and is not commercially available to anyone like ordinary humans (perhaps only some labs got it but sure cannot by on amazon or ebay or so). So if you wish to protect people you ideally need something to kill the virus in mid-air exactly as this lamp does.
Cite: ""By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin."" - this line is at the beginning of the link above.
So my idea is to help ordinary people that have some DIY experience to make a lamp and disinfect the clothes and themself like skin and face and face mask and so.
So a guy good in chemistry of similar that ca help with his knowledge and experience to help the people and get rid of the virus.
The research I did in the internet says that the UV has ability to kill virus in 10 seconds.
So having a lamp emitting harmless 222nm UV light instead the cancer deadly 254nm UV germicidal lamps will be able to protect from the diseases.
The question is how to make it.

so I suppose you can type a good way to do it and save the half of the western world population (the old people like your grandma and grandpa)?

(Nobody needs glass (or quartz) blowing of a lamp. Neither skills beyond the ordinary DIY - well it might be a need of experienced DIY-er.)
",129061,"UVC is very harmful to people and requires specialist equipment to create and use safely

You are not going to be able to create or use lamps that emit 222nM light without specialist equipment, and even if you could it would almost certainly not be safe.

Far UV lamps are widely commercially available for germicidal applications and these usually use mercury vapour fluorescent discharge tubes with no phosphors so have a strong emission around 250nM from a line in the mercury emission spectrum. They are very dangerous to people and have caused significant harm when used accidentally (see this video from BigClive describing what happens when they are used accidentally instead of the much less harmful ""black light"" tubes commonly used for discos and events). 

Another important fact to bear in mind is that UVC lamps of this type have to use specialist glass in manufacture because common types of glass strongly absorb UVC wavelengths. So, while they are readily available, they are not easy for an amateur to make.

You report a claim from a Nature paper than a tightly controlled UVC light of around 222nM wavelength is not harmful to people. I would be far more cautious as the Nature paper did not do extensive safety studies on the actual effect on people and given what we know about wavelengths not much longer, the claim would need some extensive validation.

But you have bigger problems than this in your pursuit of an easy-to-make solution accessible to amateurs. First, you cannot easily get around the problem of the glass used absorbing the wavelengths you want to see: you will need specialist material. Second, the actual excimer lamps as used in the nature paper are sophisticated devices that cannot easily be made by non-specialists (they are far more complex than the relatively conventional discharge tubes used in commercial UV lamps which are essentially the same as conventional visible fluorescent lamps apart from the need for specialist glass). Apart from anything else the lamps have a strong emission at around 258nM, exactly the wavelength known to be very dangerous to people from simple UVC mercury vapour lamps. The NAture paper reported using specialist narrow band filters to eliminate those wavelengths. These are unlikely to be easy to obtain. Third, creating the excimer lamps is a sophisticated process requiring specialist pulsed electronic drivers to get the lamp to work (most likely, according to this reference in the Nature paper, you need to fine tune the gas mixture and the pressure and the driving electronics for the lamp which is far more complex than a simple driver for a fluorescent tube).

And, as for ""Nobody needs glass (or quartz) blowing of a lamp"", I'm afraid you are delusional. You need specialist glass to let the right wavelengths through and specialist filters to kill the harmful wavelengths. This is not ""simple DIY"".

You have seen an interesting paper in Nature and assumed it is easy for someone to make in their shed. This is not true. Specialist skills are required and attempting anything without those skills is likely highly dangerous (and that is ignoring the issues of handling the chemicals and vacuum technology needed to create the lamp: both are dangerous). 

And, perhaps more importantly, the best way to avoid contamination of others with covid-19 is to wash your hands. There are no easy technological silver bullets here, though, perhaps, professional engineers and chemists can build something safe based on the Nature observation in the future.
",Reasonable,"Interesting and per your cited source, to quote:

  We used a bank of three excimer lamps containing a Kr-Cl gas mixture that predominantly emits at 222 nm 25,26. The exit window of each lamp was covered with a custom bandpass filter designed to remove all but the dominant emission wavelength as previously described 15. Each bandpass filter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) had a center wavelength of 222 nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 nm and enables >20% transmission at 222 nm. 


This is a technical area and to be honest, this may not be the best forum on how to make a lamp with a Kr-Cl gas mixture with a custom bandpass filter.

",129326,"Another possibility is the grease spot photometer (aka Bunsen photometer) German Wiki page. This can be homemade, you need a piece of paper, some wax or oil, two light sources, a meter stick and for the measurement of solutions also some e.g. cardboard to shield unwanted light. Also the darker the room, the better.

The underlying idea is that light intensity from two different sources can be compared (and found to be equal) with a paper with a grease (waxed) spot: the spot will vanish when as much light is transmitted through the spot as reflected around. 

If you move a light source to achieve this condition, you can conclude relative intensities from the distance (intensity goes 1 / d² with d the distance from the respective light source). 

Here's a youtube video demonstrating this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgZdl4qRa48



How to measure photometrically

so schematically we have:

o--U----|----o

+---d---+


with light sources o, cuvette U and the spotted paper |. Measure distance $d$ between equal intensity paper position and the light source with the cuvette. 

We have $I_{transmitted} \sim \frac{1}{d^2}$

Next, a calibration series is acquired as usual: blank (which serves as $I_0$) and concentrations over the calibration range. Almost as usual:

$$E = -\lg \frac{I}{I_0} \sim \varepsilon l c$$
$$-\lg \frac{d_0^2}{d^2} = b c$$ 
$$\lg d = a + b' c$$ 

$a$ and $b$ are determined by calibration - I use here $a$ instead of $2 \lg d_0$ because several choices are possible and in general the fitted value should be used rather than the theoretical one since it includes some effects in which practice differs from theory (e.g. differences between % transmission in the grease spot from % reflection outside).

Standard addition instead of calibration would be possible as well.
",Reasonable,"Perhaps you can add H2S to create PbS (as a starting step). Then, based on an extract from Wikipedia on Lead Sulfide:


  Although of little commercial value, PbS is one of the oldest and most common detection element materials in various infrared detectors.[12] As an infrared detector, PbS functions as a photon detector, responding directly to the photons of radiation, as opposed to thermal detectors, which respond to a change in detector element temperature caused by the radiation. A PbS element can be used to measure radiation in either of two ways: by measuring the tiny photocurrent the photons cause when they hit the PbS material, or by measuring the change in the material's electrical resistance that the photons cause. Measuring the resistance change is the more commonly used method. At room temperature, PbS is sensitive to radiation at wavelengths between approximately 1 and 2.5 μm. This range corresponds to the shorter wavelengths in the infra-red portion of the spectrum, the so-called short-wavelength infrared (SWIR). Only very hot objects emit radiation in these wavelengths.


some ideas. Perhaps examining a comparative study (based on known concentrations of Pb) of the changed in measured electrical resistance of a sample of PbS suspension taken from the solution after treating with the same volume of H2S followed by irradiation may provide a path. This not meant to be a complete answer, but a suggestion on a possible path to be explored.

[EDIT] To be clear, I am assuming that one cannot measure light absorbance, due to lack of equipment, for the purpose of establishing Pb concentration. But, one can perhaps measure electrical resistance. The question is can one construct a path (actually, more likely a graph to which a curve is fitted) to determine Pb concentration from the change in electrical resistance recorded upon applying a fixed amount of infrared radiation to a solution where varying amounts of PbS is introduced. If experimenting with known starting Pb concentrations, converted to PbS, suggests a detectable and measurably path with some degree of goodness-of-fit, then yes, else no (which is the only answer provided so far).

Here is some background on PbS based photodetectors where irradiation exposure varies and the amount of PbS concentration remains fixed.


  PbS is a standard SWIR semiconductor detector (1 - 3.3 µm) whereas PbSe is used in the MWIR range (1 - 4.7 µm when uncooled; up to 5.2 µm when cooled). Our lead salt detectors are photoconductive; the detector resistance is reduced during illumination. The crystal structure is polycrystalline and is produced via chemical deposition.


Please note the actual size of the PbS based photodetector. 

Note, my proposed study of feasibility avoids the use of a nephelometer (which can measure the concentration of some inert suspended particulates in say a liquid colloid by employing a light 'source' beam and a second light detector at 90° to the source beam) by taking advantage of the properties of irradiated PbS particulates. Also, it should be noted that a spectrophotometer, based on a quantitative measurement of the reflection or transmission properties of a material as a function of wavelength, based again on light, is also presumably not an available option.

[EDIT EDIT] Just found a reference, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE AND DISPERSED PHASE CONCENTRATION IN OIL IN WATER EMULSIONS to quote:


  The electrical resistance of a series of oil‐in‐water emulsions has been measured, and used to test the validity of four equations relating resistance with the concentration of dispersed phase. A modification of one of the equations was found to give the best relationship.


In the current context, we have a suspension of irradiated PbS in water (releasing electrons, per this 2013 article 'Photoinduced electron transfer from PbS quantum dots to cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes: light activation of a protein inhibitor'), which I would have guessed is more promising in determining the PbS concentration than say of oil in a water emulsion. 

Also found a new method to quote a source:


  In summary, we have demonstrated a practical way to measure nanoparticle concentration in a colloidal solution using quartz crystal microgravimetry. Application of a small drop of the nanoparticle colloid in a volatile organic solvent to the crystal surface leaves a dry nanoparticle film after solvent evaporation. Crystal resonant frequency shifts obeyed Sauerbrey’s equation for the dry nanoparticle concentrations up to 1300 µg/mL, as calibrated using a set of serial dilutions of Si and Ag nanopowders in methanol, rhodamine B in methanol, and ferrocene in cyclohexane.

I also tried fitting with GAs (as in the paper), also to no avail.

My question
Am I making any mistakes or is there just not enough data yet? Or is the SIR model too simple? I would appreciate suggestions on how to change the code so that I get some sensible numbers out of it.

Addendum
I wrote a blog post based on the final model and current data: Epidemiology: How contagious is Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?
",446783,"There are several points that you can improve in the code 

Wrong boundary conditions

Your model is fixed to I=1 for time zero. You can either changes this point to the observed value or add a parameter in the model that shifts the time accordingly.

init &lt;- c(S = N-1, I = 1, R = 0)

# should be

init &lt;- c(S = N-Infected[1], I = Infected[1], R = 0)


Unequal parameter scales

As other people have noted the equation  

$$I' = \beta \cdot S \cdot I - \gamma \cdot I$$

has a very large value for $S \cdot I$ this makes that the value of the parameter $\beta$ very small and the algorithm which checks whether the step sizes in the iterations reach some point will not vary the steps in $\beta$ and $\gamma$ equally (the changes in $\beta$ will have a much larger effect than changes in $\gamma$). 

You can change scale in the call to the optim function to correct for these differences in size (and checking the hessian allows you to see whether it works a bit). This is done by using a control parameter. In addition you might want to solve the function in segregated steps making the optimization of the two parameters independent from each others (see more here: How to deal with unstable estimates during curve fitting? this is also done in the code below, and the result is much better convergence; although still you reach the limits of your lower and upper bounds)

Opt &lt;- optim(c(2*coefficients(mod)[2]/N, coefficients(mod)[2]), RSS.SIR, method = ""L-BFGS-B"", lower = lower, upper = upper,
         hessian = TRUE, control = list(parscale = c(1/N,1),factr = 1))


more intuitive might be to scale the parameter in the function (note the term beta/N in place of beta)

SIR &lt;- function(time, state, parameters) {
  par &lt;- as.list(c(state, parameters))
  with(par, { dS &lt;- -beta/N * S * I
  dI &lt;- beta/N * S * I - gamma * I
  dR &lt;- gamma * I
  list(c(dS, dI, dR))
  })
}


Starting condition

Because the value of $S$ is in the beginning more or less constant (namely $S \approx N$) the expression for the infected in the beginning can be solved as a single equation:

$$I' \approx (\beta \cdot N - \gamma) \cdot I $$

So you can find a starting condition using an initial exponential fit:

# get a good starting condition
mod &lt;- nls(Infected ~ a*exp(b*day), 
           start = list(a = Infected[1],
                        b = log(Infected[2]/Infected[1])))


Unstable, correlation between $\beta$ and $\gamma$

There is a bit of ambiguity how to choose $\beta$ and $\gamma$ for the starting condition. 

This will also make the outcome of your analysis not so stable. The error in the individual parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ will be very large because many pairs of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ will give a more or less similarly low RSS. 

The plot below is for the solution $\beta = 0.8310849; \gamma = 0.4137507 $



However the adjusted Opt_par value $\beta = 0.8310849-0.2; \gamma = 0.4137507-0.2$ works just as well:





Using a different parameterization

The optim function allows you to read out the hessian

&gt; Opt &lt;- optim(optimsstart, RSS.SIR, method = ""L-BFGS-B"", lower = lower, upper = upper,
+              hessian = TRUE)
&gt; Opt$hessian
            b            
b  7371274104 -7371294772
  -7371294772  7371315619


The hessian can be related to the variance of the parameters (In R, given an output from optim with a hessian matrix, how to calculate parameter confidence intervals using the hessian matrix?). But note that for this purpose you need the Hessian of the log likelihood which is not the same as the the RSS (it differs by a factor, see the code below).

Based on this you can see that the estimate of the sample variance of the parameters is very large (which means that your results/estimates are not very accurate). But also note that the error is a lot correlated. This means that you can change the parameters such that the outcome is not very correlated. Some example parameterization would be:

$$\begin{array}{}
 c &amp;=&amp; \beta - \gamma \\
 R_0 &amp;=&amp; \frac{\beta}{\gamma}
\end{array}$$

such that the old equations (note a scaling by 1/N is used):

$$\begin{array}{rccl}
S^\prime &amp;=&amp; - \beta \frac{S}{N}&amp; I\\
I^\prime &amp;=&amp; (\beta \frac{S}{N}-\gamma)&amp; I\\
R^\prime &amp;=&amp; \gamma &amp;I
\end{array}
$$

become

$$\begin{array}{rccl}
S^\prime &amp;=&amp; -c\frac{R_0}{R_0-1}  \frac{S}{N}&amp; I&amp;\\
I^\prime &amp;=&amp; c\frac{(S/N) R_0 - 1}{R_0-1} &amp;I&amp; \underbrace{\approx c I}_{\text{for $t=0$ when $S/N \approx 1$}}\\
R^\prime &amp;=&amp; c \frac{1}{R_0-1}&amp; I&amp;
\end{array}
$$

which is especially appealing since you get this approximate $I^\prime = cI$ for the beginning. This will make you see that you are basically estimating the first part which is approximately exponential growth. You will be able to very accurately determine the growth parameter, $c = \beta - \gamma$. However, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, or $R_0$, can not be easily determined.

In the code below a simulation is made with the same value $c=\beta - \gamma$ but with different values for $R_0 = \beta / \gamma$. You can see that the data is not capable to allow us differentiate which different scenario's (which different $R_0$) we are dealing with (and we would need more information, e.g. the locations of each infected individual and trying to see how the infection spread out).

It is interesting that several articles already pretend to have reasonable estimates of $R_0$. For instance this preprint Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549)

How is R0 estimated?

The graph above (which is repeated below) showed that there is not much variation in the number of 'infected' as a function of $R_0$, and the data of the number of infected people is not providing much information about $R_0$ (except whether or not it is above or below zero).

However, for the SIR model there is a large variation in the number of recovered or the ratio infected/recovered. This is shown in the image below where the model is plotted not only for the number of infected people but also for the number of recovered people. It is such information (as well additional data like detailed information where and when the people got infected and with whom they had contact) that allows the estimate of $R_0$.



Update

In your blog article you write that the fit is leading to a value of $R_0 \approx 2$. 

However that is not the correct solution. You find this value only because the optim is terminating early when it has found a good enough solution and the improvements for given stepsize of the vector $\beta, \gamma$ are getting small. 

When you use the nested optimization then you will find a more precise solution with a $R_0$ very close to 1. 

We see this value $R_0 \approx 1$ because that is how the (wrong) model is able to get this change in the growth rate into the curve.

This is a restriction of the SIR model which models $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ where $\frac{1}{\gamma}$ is the period how long somebody is sick (time from Infected to Recovered) but that may not need to be the time that somebody is infectious. In addition, the compartment models is limited since the age of patients (how long one has been sick) is not taken into account and each age should be considered as a separate compartment.

But in any case. If the numbers from wikipedia are meaningfull (they may be doubted) then only 2% of the active/infected recover daily, and thus the $\gamma$ parameter seems to be small (no matter what model you use). 
",Accepted,"There are a few issues here, but I fear that the interpolation error of integration may be the least of them.

To start, if this work is done in a regulatory context one must use whatever procedures are required. So if there are regulatory requirements for how to estimate integration error then those take practical precedence. What follows ignores such regulations. First we'll examine the situation when the cost estimates have little or no error at the indicated event probabilities, then discuss how uncertainties in the costs and in other aspects of the modeling affect the estimated values of defenses at specified standards of protection.

If costs are known precisely

What you have displayed are the limits of the possible cost-probability curve if you know that the cost curve is non-increasing with increasing x-axis (probability) values. In this case that seems to be a reasonable assumption, as lower-probability events (higher flood stage) should have costs at least as large as higher-probability events (low or no flood stage).

The integrals estimated by the blue and red lines are Riemann sums, with the blue line providing a left Riemann sum and the red line a right Riemann sum. Your proposal to use those as outer limits for the inteterpolation error itself seems quite appropriate.

In general for smooth curves, the trapezoidal rule (which you presumably are using for your integration estimate, and is the average of the left and right Riemann sums) has a defined relationship between the integration error and a value of the second derivative of the cost-probability curve somewhere within the limits of integration. So if you can assume reasonable limits for the second-derivative values, that could set limits to the integration error. For the direction of systematic error, if you can assume that the curve is convex you know that your interpolation will over-estimate the true area.

Convexity and limits on second-derivative values might, however, not be good assumptions for flood costs. For example, there could be a fairly fast jump in costs as flood stage reached the level of first-story floors, and then another jump as flood stage reached the level of second-story floors. So convexity and assumptions about limits on second-derivative values would be questionable. That could also make it risky to try to fit a smooth curve to the set of data pairs and calculate the area analytically from the equation for the smooth curve.

So if the costs are known precisely then the limits you propose seem to be the best you can get in general for the limits of the area under the curve between the specified x-axis limits. 

With uncertainty in the costs

Estimating integration error due to interpolation does not deal with an additional source of uncertainty: the uncertainty in the y-axis cost estimates. A statistician would want to see error estimates for each of those cost values and would want you to take those error estimates into account to get a better measure of the actual error in your estimate of the value of the integral.

This is a particular problem with flood damage prediction. The x-axis probabilities typically represent the probability per year of a flood that is greater than a specified level (stage) above normal water levels. The damage associated with a particular stage may be affected by other aspects of the flood besides its level, such as its velocity or duration, adding additional uncertainty to damage estimates at any flood stage. This report compares different approaches to estimating flood risk; some simply ignore the uncertainties in stage and cost, some sample from probability distributions for certain of these estimates, and some model with event-based catastrophe models instead of continuous probability estimates.

This answer shows how errors in the estimates of y-axis values affect the estimates of integrals interpolated by the trapezoidal rule, in situations where the errors of the values at different event probabilities are uncorrelated. This simply follows the rules for variance of a weighted sum.

To get an idea of the relative contributions of interpolation and imprecise cost estimates to overall integration error, consider the integral under the curve between two event stages with cumulative probabilities (x-axis values) $p_0$ and $p_1$ ($p_0 &lt; p_1$; $p_1-p_0=\Delta p$), having associated costs of $C_0$ and $C_1$ ($C_0 &gt; C_1$).

Interpolation error. The trapezoidal rule gives an area $ (C_0 + C_1) \Delta p /2$. The upper limit of area given by the left Riemann sum is $C_0 \Delta p$, for an upper-limit difference for error above the trapezoidal estimate of $(C_0-C_1)\Delta p /2$.

Errors in $C_i$. If the variances of the $C_i$ values are $\sigma_i^2$ and the $C_i$ are uncorrelated, then the trapezoidal interpolation has an associated variance of $(\sigma_0^2 + \sigma_1^2)\Delta p^2/4$, or a standard error of $\sqrt{(\sigma_0^2 + \sigma_1^2)}\Delta p/2$.

So if the curve is relatively steep compared to the errors in the cost estimates then the interpolation error of the area will dominate. Areas over comparatively flatter parts of the curve, perhaps typical of higher-probability stages, may have integration errors dominated by the errors in the cost estimates. Similar application of the formula for the variance of a weighted sum provide the errors in the left and right Riemann sums that you propose as upper and lower estimates of integration error per se.

Other uncertainties in modeling

The full cost/benefit comparison involves more than estimating the annual benefit of installing the defense. This report shows how discount rates (to translate future gains into net present values) and expected project life are also incorporated into the calculation. There is the possibility that past history of flood probabilities does not adequately represent the future. Furthermore, future development (or abandonment) of structures in the flood plain will affect the value of installing the defense. Uncertainties in any of these estimates will add to the uncertainty in the full cost/benefit comparison.

453792,Is there a way to calculate the riskiest places to be infected by COVID-19?,"Is there a way to calculate the riskiest places to be infected by COVID-19? My friends and I are having an argument of whether being in a ""high traffic-short contact time"" situation (public transport) vs ""low traffic-high contact time"" situation (e.g. place of worship/seminar) is more risky to be infected. 

I know it's wise to avoid all of such situations in the practice. But I want to find a way to calculate it even if it requires assigning dummy/guesswork numbers for unknown probability. Where do I begin?
",453797,"First of all,

The computation is very theoretic and not a good representation or guideline for adapting your behavior (just in case, if that is what you are after). In the comments I had already mentioned several points of critique for this approach:


The problem is that these computations will be based on highly subjective estimates about the underlying model/assumptions. Yes, you can compute it.... But do not expect that the answer is rigorous just because it has used mathematics
Another problem is that the descriptions of contacts are very complex. How exactly are you gonna be in the description of the 'time of contact'? Are you differentiating just the time of contact or also the type of contact? It is not a deterministic model and you need to deal with with distributions and stochastic behaviour that will make computations more difficult.

See for example the report about transmission of SARS in airplanes: there were three cases described with an infected person on board. In one case tens of other passengers got infected. In the other two cases it was only one other person (a crew member) that got infected. 
In addition, are you gonna describe the probability for a single person, or the probability for the public health? In high traffic the probability for a single individual might be low but due to the large number of individuals in those situations there might be a probability that at least one or more persons get infected. 

For public health, the problem is not to compare cases based on the probabilities for individuals to become sick. But instead, the point is to reduce the probability for individuals spreading the virus, make others sick. In general those probabilities (to make others sick) are much higher with high traffic cases. Sick people should not be around many other people.

There are many of these strange probability effects around. For instance, in Europe there is a lot of focus on people who had contact with the high risk areas; and it seems to be ignored that one may acquire the virus locally as well.  
Indeed, when considering only a contact with a single person, then it is more likely to obtain the virus if this person is from (or had contact with) a high risk area. However, due to the much larger number of contacts with people outside the risk area it may be more likely to acquire the virus from one of those people, albeit the fact that the risk per contact is lower.  Still, it is not illogical to focus on the high risk areas. But that is more a consideration from the point of view of focusing the limited time, money and materials. Yes, it is more likely to get the coronavirus from somebody that is not from the risk area's. But there are many other viruses from which one may obtain a common cold and we can not deal with all of those cases. When we wish to focus efforts on the most important cases, then the consideration is for which people the common cold is most likely to be due to the coronavirus. In that case it is linked to the high risk areas. 




A possible solution (based on a simple model),

Let's consider the (unrealistic) probability of obtaining an infection, conditional on the other person being sick (this is a bit complex, there are different levels of being sick but let's consider this for single cases).

Say, the probability 'to get sick from a single contact of time $t$' is a function of contact time according to some (sort of) homogeneous Poisson process (ie. the waiting time to get hit/sick depends on an exponentially distributed variable and the longer the contact the more likely to get sick) 

$$P(\text{sick from contact time $t$}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}$$

If you encounter $n$ people, each for a time $t$, sampled from a population of which $p\%$ are sick...


then the number of sick people, $S$, that you encounter is binomial distributed $$P(S=s) = {{n}\choose{s}} p^s(1-p)^{n-s}$$
the probability of getting sick from those $S$ people is: $$P(\text{sick} \vert t,s) = 1- e^{-\lambda ts}$$
the marginal probability of getting sick is $$\begin{array}{}
P(\text{sick} \vert t, n) &amp; = &amp; \sum_{s=0}^n
\overset{{\substack{\llap{\text{probability}}\rlap{\text{ to encounter}} \\ 
\llap{\text{$s$ sick }}\rlap{\text{people}}  }}}{\overbrace{P(S=s)}^{}}
 \times \underset{{\substack{\llap{\text{probability to  }}\rlap{\text{get sick}} \\ \llap{\text{conditional}} \rlap{\text{ on}} \\ \llap{\text{encountering $s$}} \rlap{\text{ sick people}}
}}}{\underbrace{P(\text{sick} \vert t,s)}_{}} \\ \\
&amp;=&amp; 1- \sum_{s= 0}^n {{s}\choose{n}} p^s(1-p)^{n-s}e^{-\lambda ts} \\ &amp;=&amp; 1- \left(1- p + pe^{-\lambda t}\right)^n 
\end{array}$$ where I solved this last term with wolframalpha.


Note that 

$$\lim_{n\to \infty} 1- \left(1- p + pe^{-\lambda t/n}\right)^n = 1 - e^{-\lambda t p} $$

For a given fixed total contact  $C = n\times t \times \lambda$ you get an increase as function of $n$. For instance, if $C = 10$ then:



Intuitive overview

Below are two graphs that show the value of this term $1- \left(1- p + pe^{-\lambda t}\right)^n $ as function of contact time $t$ and number of contacts $n$. The plots are made for different values of $p$.

Note the following regions:


On the right side the contact time is very large and you are almost certainly gonna get infected if the person that you have contact with is sick. More specifically for the lower right corner (if $n=1$ and $t$ is very large) the probability of getting sick will be equal to $p$ (ie. the probability that the other person is sick). 
More generally for the right side, the region where $\lambda t&gt;1$, a change in the contact time is not gonna change much the probability to get sick from a single person (this curve $1-e^{-\lambda t}$ doesn't change much in value for large $\lambda t$).

So if $\lambda t&gt;1$ (and you are almost certainly getting sick if the other person is sick) then if you halve the contact time and double the number of contacts, then this is gonna increase the probability to get sick (because the probability to encounter a sick person increases).
On the left side for $\lambda t &lt; 1$ you will get that at some point an increase of $n$ with an equal decrease of $t$ will counter each other. On the left side it doesn't matter whether you have high traffic short time vs. low traffic high time.








Conclusion

So, say you consider total contact time $n\times t$ being constant, then this should lead to a higher probability for getting sick for higher $n$ (shorter contacts but with more people). 

Limitations

However the assumptions will not hold in practice. The time of contact is an abstract concept and also the exponential distribution for the probability of getting sick from a single person is not accurate.


Possibly there might be something like contact being more/less intense in the beginning (to compare in the simple model the probability to get sick from a single contact of time $t$ is approximately linear in time $1-e^{\lambda t} \approx \lambda t$)
Also when considering infections of groups, instead of individuals, then there might be correlations like when a sick person sneezes then it will hit multiple people at the same time. Think about the cases of superspreaders, e.g. the case of the SARS outbreak in the Amoy Gardens apartment complex where likely a single person infected hundreds of others)


So based on the simple model there is this effect that of for a given total time of contact, $n \times t$, is better to spread it out among less people, $n$. 
However, there is an opposite effect. At some point, for short $t$, the transmission will be relatively unlikely. For instance, a walk on a busy street means high $n$ but the contacts will not be meaningful to create a high risk. (Potentially you could adapt this first equation $1 - e^{\lambda t}$ but it is very subjective/broad). You could think like something as the '5 seconds rule' (which is actually not correct but gets close to the idea).

Use of the simple model

Although the model used here is very simplistic, it does still help to get a general idea about what sort of measures should be taken and how the principle would work out for a more complex model (it will be more or less analogous to the simple model): 

On the right side (of the image), it doesn't help much to change (reduce) the contact time, and it is more important to focus on reducing the number of contacts (e.g. some of the rigorous advise for non-sick family-members that are in quarantine together with sick family members are not much useful since restricting $\lambda t$ for large $\lambda t$ has little effect and it would be better to focus on making less contacts; go cook yourself instead of ordering that pizza)

On the left side, reductions should be weighed against each other. When restrictions that reduce high traffic are gonna lead to low traffic but a longer time then the measures are not gonna help a lot. 

A very clear example: I am currently waiting in line to enter the supermarket. They have decided to reduce the number of total people inside the supermarket. But this is entirely useless and possibly detrimental. The total time that we are in contact with other people does not decrease because of this. (And there are secondary effects: partners alone at home with children that have to wait longer. Potential shopping at multiple markets because time is limited at single markets. Etc. It is just silly)

I am letting the older people in the line pass before me since the health effects may be worse for them. And in the meantime I make myself annoyed about this symbolical useless measure (if not even detrimental) and have sufficient time to type this edit in this post, and in the meantime either make other people sick or become sick myself.
",Accepted,"When you write ""score ~ (1|school/trial/service)"" this treats service as a random effect, nested within trial, nested within school.

From your description, it sounds like service may actually be a fixed effect? If so, then I think you would want ""score ~ service + (1|school/trial) + (1|school/trail:service)"" - that gives you a fixed main effect for service, and a random effect for the interaction of service with trial-nested-within-school.

The answer above assumes service is categorical. If service is continuous, you will need a random slope for the interaction instead of random intercepts, eg. ""score ~ service + (1|school/trial) + (service|school/trail)"". This is not an interaction in the sense that you'll get an output value, but it does account for differing effects of service (as a continuous variable) in different trial-nested-within-school groups.

Of course, ets() will not know when to stop extrapolating the exponential growth, so this (extremely correct) rationale applies equally to ets(). You may want to consider models that are explicitly tailored towards epidemiology or (market) penetration, like the Bass diffusion model or similar.

",Accepted,"You're right that this is a very difficult problem--it's hard to test independence in general without a lot of data. There are loads of test statistics you can construct and test to try to reject the null hypothesis of i.i.d. samples, but unless you guess the mechanism of the dependence correctly or have a huge sample size, such statistics (like you describe in your problem) can have very low power.

If $U_1,U_2,\ldots,U_n$ are ""random"" integers, you could do a chi-square test of independence on sequences of a given length $k$. Then you've got $n-k$ observed sequences, and each should occur with probability $10^{-k}$.

Suppose you have some a priori knowledge of the dependence; for instance, you suspect that an adversary is trying to make the sequence look independent to the human eye, and so they make sure every number in the sequence is different from the last. Then using $k=2$ in the previous paragraph will uncover the dependence, because the 10 ""doubles"" will never appear in the sequence and the chi-square test for independence will reject. But if the dependence mechanism is something else, this test may not pick it up.

The UK Royal Office of Obstetricians and Gynecologists publishes guidelines on neonatal and prenatal treatment of Corona positive women and babies of Corona positive women. There is insufficient evidence to give an advice whether breastfeeding is safe in the sense of not passing virus from mother to child via the mother milk. There are other infection ways but mother milk could be expressed and fed while keeping distance, e.g. by father.

A source is quoted in the guidelines (p. 27) that 6 Chinese women's breast milk was tested Corona negative; that is, six of out six samples were negative. If we consider these tests independent events, where the event is to sample a woman who passes the virus via the mothermilk, we have a binomial trial.

Which confidence or credibility statements can we make about the probability to pass on the virus to the mother milk? This probability is estimated at zero in this trial, of course. 

Some statements can be made; for example if the probability was 0.50 the likelihood of the data would be 0.015. If it approaches 0, the likelihood approaches 1, but it is not differentiable at zero, so standard likelihood inference fails.

Please note: The same guidelines advise in section 4.8.2 to continue breastfeeding by COVID-19 positive women: ' In the light of the current evidence, we advise that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. The risks and benefits of breastfeeding, including the risk of holding the baby in close
proximity to the mother, should be discussed with her.' (p. 27)

EDIT: since you said that years are not serially correlated, this simplifies your situation a lot! You can then treat the years as if they were just data points, and select the testing sets totally randomly. You can do e.g. 3-fold crossvalidation by splitting the data in 3 randomly selected set of years, run the model 3 times (see how N-fold cross-validation works), and then put together all the 3 independently predicted testing sets from those 3 models and evaluate them with the Nash-sutcliffe coefficient, which seems to be a good measure of the model efficiency.

Chose the model with the best coefficient. Cross-validation assures  that you do not overfit in those single models tested. However, since during the model selection procedure itself you use the whole dataset, there is a risk that you can overfit in that model selection procedure itself, if you overdo it, as fittingly pictured in the chart below:

",454983,"One of the differences is the likelihoods for each model.  In case readers can't remember, the likelihood encapsulates assumptions about the conditional distribution of the data.  In the case of COVID-19, this would be the distribution of infections (or reported new cases, or deaths, etc) on the given day.  Whatever we want the outcome to be, let's call it $y$.  Thus, the conditional distribution (e.g. the number of new cases today) would be $y\vert t$ (think of this as $y$ conditioned on $t$).


In the case of taking the log and then performing lm, this would mean that $\log(y)\vert t \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu(x), \sigma^2) $.  Equivalently, that $y$ is lognormal given $t$. The reason we do linear regression on $\log(y)$ is because on the log scale, the conditional mean is independent of the variance, where as the mean of the log normal is also a function of the variance. So Pro: we know how to do linear regression, but Con This approach makes linear regression assumptions on the log scale which can always be assessed but might be hard to theoretically justify?  Another con is that people do not realize that predicting on the log scale and then taking the exponential actually biases predictions by a factor if $\exp(\sigma^2/2)$ if I recall correctly.  So when you make predictions from a log normal model, you need to account for this.  
So far as I understand, nls assumes a Gaussian likelihood as well, so in this model $ y \vert t \sim \mathcal{N}(\exp(\beta_0 + \beta t), \sigma^2)$.  Except now, we let the conditional mean of the outcome be non-linear.  This can be a pain because no confidence intervals are not bounded below by 0, so your model might estimate a negative count of infections.  Obviously, that can't happen.  When the count of infections (or whatever) is larger, then a Gaussian can justifiable.  But when things are just starting, then this probably isn't the best likelihood.  Furthermore, if you fit your data using nls, you'll see that it fits later data very well but not early data.  That is because misfitting later data incurrs larger loss and the goal of nls is to minimize this loss.
The approach with glm frees is a little and allows us to control the conditional distribution as well as the form of the conditional mean through the link function. In this model, $y \vert t \sim \text{Gamma}(\mu(x), \phi)$ with $\mu(x) = g^{-1}(\beta_0 + \beta_1)$.  We call $g$ the link, and for the case of log link $\mu(x) = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 t)$. Pro These models are much more expressive, but I think the power comes from the ability to perform inference with a likelihood which is not normal.  This lifts a lot of the restrictions, for example symmetric confidence intervals. The Con is that you need a little more theory to understand what is going on.

",Accepted,"I suggest you think carefully about the context of the question in practice. 

You could model the source and destination as GPS coordinates rather than streets and house numbers. In this case your outcome will be two numbers: the x and the y coordinate.
Your approach would require multi-class classification and one way to encode the outcome would be as a one-hot encoded matrix.

If there are many source and destination values, then the curse of dimensionality is a valid concern. Some algorithms are designed to handle many categorical dimensions, e.g. catBoost. The underlying idea here is to replace each level in the categorical variable by a noisy average of the target variable for that level. That turns a categorical variable into a single continuous variable.

The other state-of-the-art approach is use separate input layers for categorical variables in a neural network, a model structure know as embedding (layers). The embedding layer reduces the large dimensionality into a lower dimensional representation that serves as input to the prediction layer/linear model. This has been shown to be effective in a taxi competition on Kaggle 

EDIT: Twelve unique source destination are likely not an issue w.r.t dimensionality. The above solutions handle categories in the hundreds or thousands.

454986,Back calculate intercept from multivariable COVID-19 logistic regression model,"I am interested in creating a web tool to predict the absolute risk of in-hospital death from a published risk model of COVID-19 patients.  

Is it possible to estimate the intercept from the significant, multivariable model coefficients published(Table 3 at https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3)?
",454993,"No, for a few reasons.  The most relevant is that, even if you could numerically determine the value of the intercept term in the model, you would not be able to tell what conditions are represented by the intercept term of the model fit by the researchers (unless they provided some very specific details about their methods, e.g., ""did they center their predictors"", etc.).

The way these models are defined, you need to know what the ""reference"" point of each coefficient is.  By convention the reference point for continuous variables is often zero, but the choice of reference is completely arbitrary for categorical variables (though it does appear to be stated in the article).

On a more conceptual note, models like this one are often limited in their ability to predict accurate ""class probabilities ""because their goal is to explain relationships between predictors, or to describe relative risk-reducing or risk-increasing relationships among the predictors in the model.  Often these models use only a limited number of variables to arrive at a parsimonious model, which tries to keep multicollinearity low, so that the individual effects of predictors are easier to interpret.  

Another way of looking at it is this:  The model may have been designed to address research questions  such as: ""what is the relative importance of age with respect to the risk of an in-hospital death after controlling for other demographic factors?"".  Even if the model does this very well, it may be very bad at answering fundamentally different questions, such as ""What is the probability that a female will experience an in-hospital death?""

  the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of COVID-19. Last but not least, interpretation of our findings might be limited by the sample size


I would add that this study is limited to the very specific case of Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, and might be completely different elsewhere. So whether they had 191 patients a lot more or a lot less does not matter. It is only a case of two hospitals in a single region and you do not know much about variation from place to place, which makes predictions very difficult.

455031,Sampling a changing distribution over time,"I'm interested in learning more about sampling a changing population over time. For example, these statistics from the University of Washington coronavirus testing show a 7% positive rate day after day. Some news outlets are interpreting this as a positive: ""One encouraging sign is that in Washington State, which had an early outbreak, the number of positive tests appears stable.""

http://depts.washington.edu/labmed/covid19/
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-outcomes.html

Can someone suggest a branch of statistics or papers for further study that would help me assess the veracity of such claims? My intuitive reasoning, as described below, shows why I am questioning the optimistic interpretation, but I would like to learn a more formalized framework.



For instance, let's say that the population proportion that tests positive for an attribute is 7%, and that proportion is stable. If I took a random sample each day, I should be getting 7% consistently, subject to some variance.

However, let's say the population proportion is subject to change over time. Let's also add the assumption that I am trying to prioritize sampling people (without replacement) that I believe are most likely to be positive. Eventually I will sample the whole population. Under these new assumptions, if the population proportion were stable, you would expect my initial sample proportions to overshoot, and my final sample proportions to under shoot as I ran out of likely positives. That would imply that if my sample proportion was constant and did NOT drift down over time, then my population proportion MUST be increasing over time. And if my sample proportion was increasing over time, then my population proportion must be increasing by a heck of a lot over time.

These are just qualitative conclusions I can come to. Is there a branch of statistics I can learn about to help me make concrete conclusions about a changing population proportion given sample proportions over time? I am sure that as you vary the sample size across time, the conclusions also change. Any framework to help understand the tweaks and their effects would be great.

Thank you.
",455087,"OK, the service area is likely many hundreds of thousands for the U of Washington and for certain patients covers a five state area. The detection rate for a tertiary/quaternary referral center reflects the patient selection process, same criteria for referring patients in distress might lead to same detection rate. However, more precisely one cannot make inferences on that basis because the criteria for patient selection for testing is an uncontrolled variable.

To explain this a bit more, a primary or community hospital would refer patients to a larger regional hospital which refers patients to a specialized tertiary care hospital, and for certain problems, tertiary care hospitals would send patients to a quaternary care facility. Even more complicated, a local physician in the community, might refer a patient directly to a quaternary care facility, or the patient might walk in to the emergency room off of the street.  So, there are so many confounders that any correlation  you might make risks being spurious. BTW, the raw data you linked to was not organized for peer review, I review for 17 medical journals, and I am telling you as simply as I can that without controlling for the referral pattern, there is only limited use for the raw data.

  A guess: The heatmap corresponds to the ellipsoidal contours of a multivariate Gaussian density obtained by fitting the data (probably by maximum likelihood or similar). The white contour lines correspond to the conditional (Gaussian) density obtained from conditioning on the given height, so, e.g., the bottom line is the density for weights given a height of 140 (cm, I'd guess).

455077,Recent mortality,"Recently there are a lot of datapoints regarding COVID-19 related deaths. However I am looking to see how big the impact of non-diagnosed patients is.

Therefore I want to evaluate the deaths (corrected for reported virus deaths) and see how these compare to the same period in recent years.

I understand it is best practice to avoid asking for specific data sets here, so I will keep my question as generic as possible and ask for leniency:

Does anyone know how to find (or search for) recent mortality statistics? Ideally this would be ""per day per country up to today"", but even ""a total for February in a continent or city would already be insightful"".



What have I tried so far: 


Searching recent mortality, this only results in virus related statistics
Searching for several countries or WHO, this did not result in anything for this year

",455219,"It doesn't seem like the death toll is clearly showing up (yet). 

For instance, Europe has almost up to 10 000 deaths in a single day during the peak of a heavy respiratory season, and the Covid-19 cases will only be a small bump, in relation to the overall burden of disease.

But, that would be playing down the impact of the virus. It is difficult to look at the overall death rate. Many people are dying every day. We can not easily compare a single cause to the total amount of deaths that are occurring.

Important to consider is that Covid-19 deaths have a non-homogeneous spatial distribution and locally there's a high density that's not clear in common (public) databases that (mostly) present aggregate numbers. Also, the outbreak is still young and is not yet fully processed in databases. So with better data we might be better able to see the impact of the disease (I suspect that the agencies have better information).

So the fact that we currently see little influence of Covid-19 on aggregated statistics of death rate is not reassuring because it is meaningless to look at aggregated statistics (this depends a bit on your philosophy about nature and death though, personally I feel we are overreacting, but that is completely different from statistics). 

See also this note from EuroMomo


  Note concerning COVID-19 related mortality as part of the all-cause mortality figures reported by EuroMOMO
  
  Over the past few days, the EuroMOMO hub has received many questions about the weekly all-cause mortality data and the possible contribution of any COVID-19 related mortality. Some wonder why no increased mortality is observed in the reported mortality figures for the COVID-19 affected countries.
  The answer is that increased mortality that may occur primarily at subnational level or within smaller focal areas, and/or concentrated within smaller age groups, may not be detected at the overall national level. This even more so in the pooled European-wide analysis, given the large total population denominator. Furthermore, there is always a few weeks of delay in death registration and reporting. Hence, the EuroMOMO mortality figures for the most recent weeks must be interpreted with some caution.
  Therefore, although increased mortality is currently not being observed in the EuroMOMO figures, this does not mean that increased mortality does not occur in some areas or in some age groups, including mortality related to COVID-19.

",Accepted,"Why are errors correlated in the reduced-form VAR?
If the error covariance matrix were restricted to be diagonal in the reduced form, the model would be too restrictive to adequately represent most of real-world time series. You could specify such a restricted model, but the assumption of diagonal covariance matrix would often be violated in practice.

Why are errors uncorrelated in the structural VAR?
Structural VAR with contemporaneous effects and uncorrelated errors is another representation of the same reduced-form VAR model. For convenience of interpretation, the structural representation is defined by lack of error correlation. Other representations with contemporaneous effects but correlated errors are possible but are less interesting.

This distribution is widely used in psychology or economics. 



Note that for certain values, it looks close to a Gaussian ""bell-shaped"" distribution. As a side note, mathematically, it is certainly not a Gaussian as the support for a Gaussian is the set of real numbers, while the variable you want to describe (""time since first case"") is the set of positive reals.

Data are:


10 million people live in Lombardy.
P can be assumed to be at least 4 %.
No assumption can be made about the uniform distribution of P, neither geographically, nor by age, gender or whatever.
A satisfactory error percent on P would be 25%.

",457259,"This is actually a handbook example of determining the sample size needed for estimating binomial proportion (e.g. Jones et al, 2004, Naing, 2003 for other references and examples).

First of all, to make it more precise, we are talking about finding such sample size, that with probability $\alpha$, the difference between the true probability of being infected $p$ and it's estimate $\hat p$ is not greater then $(100\times\delta\,)\%$

$$
\Pr(|p - \hat p| \le \delta p) = \alpha
$$

Given that the target population is large, we would usually assume binomial distribution to represent it, i.e. we say that it is large enough, that the chance of randomly sampling someone more then once is negligible. The distribution is parametrized by probability of ""success"" (here, probability of being infected) $p$ and the number of samples we draw $n$. Let's denote the observed number of infected people as $k$, in such case, $\hat p = k/n$ is the fraction of infected people in the sample and we treat it as an estimate of the number of infected people in the whole population. If we wanted to calculate confidence interval for $\hat p$, we could use normal approximation

$$
\hat p \pm z_\alpha \sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}
$$

where $z_\alpha$ is the ordinate from standard normal distribution, where for $z$ drawn from standard normal distribution we have $\Pr(-z_\alpha &lt; z &lt; z_\alpha) = \alpha$. You are saying, that you'd like to see this interval to be equal to $\hat p \pm \delta p$. As discussed in the linked resources, you can solve this, so that for given $p$, precision $\delta$, and certanity $\alpha$, you can guesstimate the sample size needed

$$
n \approx \Big(\frac{z_\alpha}{\delta p}\Big)^2 \; p(1-p)
$$

Assuming $(100 \times \alpha)\% = 99\%$ confidence interval, we can plot this for different values of $p$, to find out that for $100 \times p &gt; 4 \%$ the needed sample sizes are generally not much larger then $2000$ samples.



For example, for $p=0.04$ ($4\%$ infected) this yields:



&gt; z &lt;- function(alpha) qnorm(alpha)
&gt; n &lt;- function(p, alpha=0.99, delta=0.25) (z(alpha)/(p*delta))^2 * p*(1-p)
&gt; n(0.04)
[1] 2078.167


To convince yourself, you can verify this by simulation, where you would draw $n$ samples from binomial distribution with probability of infection $p$, repeat this procedure $R$ times, and then verify how often was your result not further then $(100 \times \delta) \%$ from the true value:

&gt; set.seed(123)
&gt; sim &lt;- function(p, n, delta, nsim=50000) mean(abs(p - rbinom(nsim, n, p)/n) / p &lt;= delta)
&gt; sim(0.04, 2078, 0.25)
[1] 0.97858


So we wanted to be $99\%$ sure and the approximation gives us, while the in the simulation, in $97.8\%$ cases the result was within the interval. Not bad.

Notice that this is just a simple approximation for the calculation, assuming simple random sampling. In case of whole population locked in their houses, sampling individuals at random may be not as hard as in case of most of the usual surveys. On another hand, things may not go as smooth as planned, or you may be willing to use other sampling schema, to have higher chance for it being representative, what would make calculating it more complicated. Moreover, the tests used aren't perfect and give false results as described, for example by New York Times, or Washington Post, and you'd need to account for that as well. Also you need to remember, there were many examples where such simple problems get more complicated then expected, e.g. social surveys on Trump's support before the election got very wrong, nonetheless that they used state of art survey methodology.
",Accepted,"What you are seeing is exactly what one would expect. The condition number of your matrix $X$ is about $10^6$. Double precision floating point calculations give about 18 figures of accuracy so, in double precision, you would expect to get at most $18-6=12$ significant figures for the estimated coefficients from QR and at most $18-6-6=6$ significant figures from Choleski, after allowing for accuracy lost due to conditioning.
(Choleski loses twice the number of significant figures because forming $X^TX$ squares the condition number.)
Hence the coefficients from the two algorithms should start to differ in the 6th significant figure, which is exactly what you see. Your results show that for x2 the relative difference between the two algorithms is about
$$ 0.2 / 148232 = 1.35 \times 10^{-6},$$
which matches the condition number you started out with surprisingly well.

The condition number of $X$ is a reasonable guide to precision when the residuals are small. If we make sure that the exact coefficients are 1 and 1.00001 by

&gt; y &lt;- X %*% c(1,1.00001)


and rerun your calculation we get

x2 1.0000266455870466 1.000010000031673


confirming that QR is in fact correct to 12 significant figures and Choleski is correct to 6 significant figures.

The fitted values from Choleski are generally more precise than the estimated coefficients. If the fitted values are more important to you than the coefficients, and that will often be so in a highly collinear cases, then Choleski is usually fine.
Choleski is also about as good as QR when the residuals are very large, but this is the hardest case for both algorithms.
My PhD supervisor was Australia's foremost numerical analysis (Mike Osborne) and he used to say that Choleski was not as bad as it's made out to be.

The full sensitivity analysis for Choleski vs QR is given in Section 5.3.8 of Golub and Van Loan (1996), and is very much more complex than the simple calculation I used above. The sensitivity of Choleski is roughly proportion to $\kappa + \rho \kappa^2$ where $\kappa$ is the condition number of $X$ and $\rho$ is a theoretical quantity that is almost impossible to compute in practice.
$\rho$ depends on the size of the residuals-- it is roughly proportional to but much smaller than the average squared residual.
The sensitivity of QR is somewhat better than Choleski although not always as good as I have suggested above. Golub and Van Loan remark:


  At the very minimum, this discussion should convince you how difficult it can be to choose the ""right"" algorithm!

1 Derivation of the LS estimator

1.1 definitions


Let's consider the dataset $D_T\triangleq\{y_0,\dots,y_T\}$ up to the observation horizon $T$, where $y_t\triangleq[S_t, I_t, R_t, D_t]'$ is the vector of the observed values at time $t$ for the variables $S,I,R,D$. Here $'$ denotes the transpose operation, thus $y_t$ is a column vector in $\mathbb{N}^{4\times1}$;
Let $\theta\triangleq[\alpha, \beta, \gamma]'$ be the generic vector of parameters. The prediction model $\hat{y}_t(\theta)$ is $(1)$, so
$$\tag{2}
    \hat{y}_t(\theta)\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    S_{t-1}-\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}  \\ 
    I_{t-1}+\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta I_{t-1}-\gamma I_{t-1}  \\  
    R_{t-1}+\beta I_{t-1} \\  
    D_{t-1}+\gamma I_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots   
$$
with the convention that $\hat{y}_0(\theta)\triangleq 0$;
Let $V_T(\theta)\triangleq \frac{1}{2}\sum _{t=0}^T \|y_t-\hat{y}_t(\theta) \|^2$ the quadratic cost up to $T$. Here $\| \cdot \|$ denotes the euclidian norm. The least square estimator $\theta_\text{LS}$ of the 'real' parameter $\bar{\theta}$ is defined as
$$\tag{3}\theta_\text{LS}\triangleq \arg\min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R^3}} V_T (\theta)$$
i.e. the minimum for the cost $V_T$.


1.2 analitic solution of $(3)$ 

the idea to solve $(3)$ is to use the standard technique by solving with respect to $\theta$ the equation
$$\tag{4}\frac{\partial V_T(\theta)}{\partial \theta}=0$$
the solution is a minimum for $V_T$ since $(3)$ is a convex problem under mild assumptions regarding the dataset $D_T$ (invertibility of the next matrix $R_T$ defined below). In order to solve $(4)$, let's start by observing that the prediction model $(2)$ is linear in their parameters. In fact we can write that
$$\tag{5}\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$
by introducing the regression matrices in $\mathbb{R^{4\times3}}$
$$\tag{6}\varphi_t \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ 
    \phantom{-}\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -I_{t-1} &amp; -I_{t-1}  \\

    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \phantom{-}I_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$
with the conventions that $\varphi_0, y_{-1}=0$. From $(5)$ it follows straightforward that the gradient of the cost $V_T$ is
$$\tag{7}\begin{align}\frac{\partial V_T(\theta)}{\partial \theta} &amp;= \sum_{t=0}^T - \frac{\partial \hat{y}_t (\theta)}{\partial \theta}[y_t-\hat{y}_t(\theta)]\\
&amp;=-\sum_{t=0}^T \varphi_t'[y_t-(\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1})] \\
&amp;=\sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t'[\varphi_t \theta - \Delta y_t] \\
&amp;=\left(\sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t '\varphi_t\right)\theta - \sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t'\Delta y_t
\end{align}$$ 
where $\Delta y_t \triangleq y_t-y_{t-1}$. If we introduce the matrix $R_T\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$ and the vector $\tilde{\theta}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
$$\tag{8}R_T\triangleq \sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t '\varphi_t \qquad \tilde{\theta}_T\triangleq \sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t'\Delta y_t$$
the gradient in $(7)$ gets the following final sintetic expression
$$\tag{9}\frac{\partial V_T(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = R_T\theta-\tilde{\theta}_T$$
now, by combining $(4)$ with $(9)$ and by resolving with respect $\theta$, we can finally conclude that the least square estimator that we are searching is
$$\tag{10}\boxed{\theta_\text{LS}=R_T^{-1}\tilde{\theta}_T}$$

2 Naive implementation in Python

2.1 dataset

I want to estimate $\bar{\theta}$ for the COVID-19 epidemy in Italy, so I've built the  dataset by retrieving from worldometers.info the number of infected $I_t$, recovered $R_t$ and dead $D_t$ individuals day by day. Since $S_t+I_t+R_t+D_t=N$ is costant in time, the number of susceptibles day by day is $S_t=N-(I_t+R_t+D_t)$.  

2.2 least squares estimation of the parameters

in order to compute $(10)$, we need: 


to build $\varphi_t$ and $\Delta y_t$. For the former we can use the definition $(6)$, for the latter we can observe that
$$\tag{11} \Delta y_t \triangleq y_t-y_{t-1}=\begin{bmatrix}
    S_t-S_{t-1}  \\ 
    I_t-I_{t-1}  \\  
    R_t-R{t-1} \\  
    D_t-D_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$ 
to build $R_T$ and $\tilde{\theta}_T$. The idea to compute $(8)$ is to accumulate during the time the products $\varphi_t ' \varphi_t$ and $\varphi_t '\Delta y_t$.


After this 2 simple step the estimation is given by $(10)$.

2.3 simulation  

for the simulation we use the prediction model $(1)$ with the least squares parameters that we have just found. For the initial condition of the simulation I consider the situation where in the population there is only one infected individual that spreads the  disease to the other people.

$$\begin{cases}
S_{0}&amp;=N-1 \\ 
I_{0}&amp;=1 \\
R_{0}&amp;=0 \\
D_{0}&amp;=N-(S_0+I_0+R_0) \\
\end{cases}$$
here the starting number of dead individuals is obtained by imposing the costraint $S_0+I_0+R_0+D_0=N$.

Your equation number 5 should be

$$\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + \hat{y}_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$

instead of

$$\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$

Also you compute the derivative $\varphi$ based on the matrix that contains values of $S, I ,R, D$ that are the observed values, but $\varphi$ should relate to the modeled values.

I am not sure whether you can continue your attempt to solve this analytically after correcting those mistakes. It looks a bit like how people solve equations with the finite element method and potentially you could solve it in that way as well (but it will be an approximation in terms of polynomial functions, and is not exact). 

Another way to solve it is to put the equations as a function, and have some solver optimize it (you can have the solver estimate the gradient). You can read about that here: Fitting SIR model with 2019-nCoV data doesn&#39;t conververge

In addition: You can recast the equations into a single differential equation. For the SIR model this is demonstrated here:

Tiberiu Harko, Francisco S. N. Lobo, M. K. Mak  Exact analytical solutions of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model and of the SIR model with equal death and birth rates arXiv:1403.2160 [q-bio.PE]

The SIRD model is almost analogous. It is nearly the same model, with only the R split up in two. So you can use this differential equation to make initial estimates of parameters. 



Also

Fitting this kind of data to some model might be a bad idea. The SIR type of models are some sort of logistic growth type models where the growth starts approximately exponentially but eventually the growth rate decreases. It is due to such terms like $dI/dt = I * (factor)$ where the factor is decreasing as $I$ (and $R$ and $D$) grow (in the case of logistic growth the factor is $1-I$, for the SIRD model it a bit more sophisticated but not much different).

However, in the case of the corona epidemic, you get a decrease in the growth rate for a multitude of reasons.


Weather changes ($R_0$ is not a constant)
Spatial distribution (This virus spreads in from place to place, and should not be considered with compartmental models that assume homogeneous mixing; a person in Milan is much more likely to infect their family, neighbors, co-workers than a random person in the rest of Lombardy)
Stochastic Time effects. The article that you refer to tries to bring autocorrelation into the mixture, but you also have some stochastic behavior, people are not gonna get sick exactly at the same time. Some people will get sick earlier than others and this will be according to some function that increases in time and that will make an increase of cases or deaths that might appear as an exponential growth that relates to a transmission model, but it might be not. 
Sampling bias. We can also see rapid increase in the sampling due to biassed sampling. Definitions of the disease are changing (this gave a rapid bump in the curve for Chinese), tests might be limited (several countries are limiting their testing which might give false ideas of reduction in the growth of the cases), positive reinforcement (once people have discovered the disease suddenly many other cases might become assigned to the same cause, and this may potentially occur inaccurate because a single cause of death is not always possible to assign)

The last to points Sampling Bias and Stochastic time behavior might have occured in the outbreak of SARS (2003) in Amoy Gardens where hundreds of people got sick in a very short time frame. Instead of fitting a model to it, one could also assume that all these hundreds of cases were infected by a single person (and that might be a more likely scenario). Possibly such a situation may have occurred in Italy as well, an initial heavy seeding by unnoticed cases that is now spreading with some time effect and causes the initial exponential decrease (currently the growth looks more like a quadratic curve).
Last but not least, people respond to the virus which may cause it's spread to increase/decrease. Currently heavy measures have been taken and this restricts to a large extend the ability of the virus to spread. You can not model this with a model that has parameters that are constant in time (well, you can, but the outcome will be meaningless)


The logistic SIR type models will interpret all those reasons for a reduction in the growth rate as a reproduction rate very close to 1 or a low population parameter (you fixed it at the size of the population under study, but this is arbitrary, and also not everybody is gonna be susceptible, possibly many people might have some sort of immunity and get little infected, e.g. a Hoskin's effect or some other effect might make only/mostly the elderly population susceptible).

This makes the seemingly mechanistic model, meaningless regarding the parameters. The outcome will be unrealistic.
",Accepted,"What's happening is that R and Stata use quite different approaches to estimating the population standard deviation. R goes directly via the mean of $(X-\bar X)^2$ and Stata goes via an estimated standard error of the mean (under simple random sampling). 

As a result, Stata's estimate depends on values outside the subpopulation (as is unarguably correct for the standard error of the mean) and R's doesn't (as is at least arguably correct for the subpopulation standard deviation).  

For example, you can get the 2.198 in the Stata output as

&gt; sqrt(2.47162^2*571.16/139.77*6/31)
[1] 2.198105


where 2.47162 is the R estimate, 571.16 is the estimated population size (sum of weights), 139.77 is the estimated subpopulation size (sum of weights), 6 is 7-1 and 31 is 32-1. 

As you can see, it isn't easy to convert; it's probably easier to just implement the formula from the Stata manual if you want the Stata version.

457863,How to analyze if a specific event caused an increase in coronavirus cases?,"I'm going to post a question related to the current events and I think it could be very interesting.

In the midst of the crisis with the coronavirus, Croatian capital of Zagreb was hit by a strong earthquake on March 22. Since a lot of people escaped their homes in panic, there were fears that the earthquake would cause an increase in the cases of coronavirus since people didn't obey the rules of social distancing when they escaped outside due to the earthquake.

The Director of the Croatian Institute for Public Health, Krunoslav Capak, said that they conducted some preliminary analyses that suggest that the earthquake didn't cause an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The analyses are preliminary becuase the incubation period of the virus is known to be as long as 14 days, so it's possible that the effect is not visible yet.

Regardless of the incubation period length, I was confused by Capak's statement because I cannot think of a statistical method I would use to make that inference. Does anyone know what analyses was Capak referring to? What statistical analyses would be appropriate to determine if there was an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Croatia due to the earthquake?

The number of coronavirus cases in Croatia can be found here: https://github.com/viborccom/data/blob/master/covid-19/croatia/time-series.csv?fbclid=IwAR2ekRN44WnKwlTQJAgpfYyJTz01GedrqJupB28d-g_KoGBnroIGWt8Jb58
",457922,"You might wonder whether an increased infection rate during a short period could be observed in the figures of reports on infected cases or the death rate.

However, this is not feasible with the data available


The effect get's diluted The effect is likely to be very small in the observations (unless the infection rate is very large). 


If there is an increase in transmission then this will occur only in a small group, which gets diluted by the larger total number of Zagreb and the surroundings. 
Also the time of the event is only very short and the contact between people is very local. Social distancing is 'the way to go', but it matters with which persons and how long you have contact. 

Complete strangers in a supermarket are much more a risk than your neighbors (if your neighbors got the virus than you are already at high risk to get the virus as well, being outside is not gonna change this a lot). There is a large multitude of ways how the virus can spread. If we are traveling a lot, moving around over long distances, then the virus is moving a large distance quickly and will infect a lot of people quickly. The local transmission is of less concern (in terms of speed of transmission, and flattening the curve, the local transmission is eventually determining how many people get sick. The long range transmission is determining how fast people get sick*).

Ad hoc ergo propter hoc Even if there is a change in the trend/growth in the number of infections or the number of death cases, then it will be very difficult to connect this observation to a specific event. There are too many variables that are changing such that it is not possible to draw strong conclusions about causal relationships based on correlations.

The current cases in Zagreb and Croatia are very small. So the number will be expected to rise, already without an earthquake. This rise will occur with lots of uncertainty**. The information and background information is so noisy that it is not possible to make a lot of sensible predictions.

See the past reports on the cases below. The curve is not a nice straight line and is varying in growth rate and bumpy. It is very difficult to make a specific relation between specific events and this curve. That is because the time between infection, start of symptoms, and start of registration/confirmation occurs with an unknown delay.


Time delay Also, there is a delay in reporting of the numbers. This makes the above effects count stronger. It will take two weeks before the effect of increased transmission is measurable. But at that time many more events have happened which may cause an effect as well. And also the time delay is a random value. What happens now in a single day, will not create a sudden peak of a single day two weeks later, but instead it gets spread out over multiple days and becomes less noticeable (and then there are also large high noise levels in the measurements which might be a fourth point). 
denominator. Furthermore, there is always a few weeks of delay in death registration and reporting. Hence, the EuroMOMO mortality figures for the most recent weeks must be interpreted with some caution.




*A simple model that shows how the reduction in the long-range transmission is having a strong effect and going on the streets and have local community spread is slightly less worrisome. I used the code from this answer which made used of a $R_0$ for short distance transmission and a $R_1$ for long distance transmission. I did two computations, one with $R_1 = 0.25 , R_0 = 2.25$ and one with one with $R_1 = 0 , R_0 = 2.5$. The total reproduction rate, $2.5$, is the same, but the models deviate quickly once the infection reaches the edges of the neighborhood.

**In the Netherlands the officials were counting on a very specific rise of cases in the Intensive Care. Now... they are surprised that it did not turn out to be that specific number and it is a larger number than predicted (they were expecting 1600 people in the Intensive Care at some date, and not this is gonna happen a week earlier than expected)

Me... I am surprised that they are surprised about the number turning out to be different. These sort of predictions should have been made with a very wide confidence interval indicating that there is very little certainty about the forecasts.

459046,Parameter Estimation for the SIRD model via Kalman Filter,"0 Introduction

This is my third attempt in tuning a good prediction SIRD model for the COVID-19 outbreak. The model in question is the following:
$$\tag{12}\begin{cases}
S_{t}&amp;=S_{t-1}-\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} \\ 
I_{t}&amp;=I_{t-1}+\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta I_{t-1}-\gamma I_{t-1} \\
R_{t}&amp;=R_{t-1}+\beta I_{t-1} \\
D_{t}&amp;=D_{t-1}+\gamma I_{t-1} \\
\end{cases} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$



0.1 first attempt

In my first try I've used for the estimation of the parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ a very simple strategy by searching the least squares parameters that minimize the quadratic cost of the 1-step prediction along all the observation horizon. The complete dissertation of this problem is here (note: in this thread I will use the same notations that I've used in the cited thread).
The estimation problem is very easy to resolve, but leads to a result with very poor performances.



0.2 second attempt

As Sextus Empiricus suggests to me, using the 1-step prediction, i.e.
$$\tag{13}\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$
is not a good idea because, once one has found the parameters, during the simulation phase the model haves to feedback the proper previous predictions. This means, in principle, that the right way to tune the parameters $\theta$ is to minimize some suitable cost function of the prediction errors generated by a ""batch"" predictor of the form
$$\tag{14}\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\hat\varphi(\hat{y}_{t-1}) \theta + \hat{y}_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$
where
$$\tag{15}\hat\varphi(\hat{y}_{t-1}) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ 
    \phantom{-}\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1}  \\  
    0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; 0\\  
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$
and $\hat{S}_{t-1}, \hat{I}_{t-1}$ are predictions (and not observed values) generated by the model. As a consequence, the new estimation problem 
$$\tag{16}\theta_\text{LS}\triangleq \arg\min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R^3}} V_T (\theta)$$
with the same quadratic cost $V_T(\theta)\triangleq \frac{1}{2}\sum _{t=0}^T \|y_t-\hat{y}_t(\theta) \|^2$ is not easy anymore because now the considered model $(14)$ is not linear in his parameter $\theta$.

To resolve $(16)$, under the suggestion Sextus Empiricus, I've chosen a numerical approach. More precisely, I've used a simple gradient descent equipped with Armijo's adaptive learning rate / step update, with a simple finite-difference approximation of the gradient. The optimization works pretty well, but from the starting guess $\theta_{\text{LS},0}=0$ converges to a parameter $\theta_{\text{LS},\infty}$ with a non-zero cost that doesn't satisfies me in the final simulation phase.

I've tried several different optimizations by using randomly different initializations $\theta_{\text{LS},0}$ (like a MultiStart global optimization policy) with even worse results. 



0.3 third attempt

I'm quite sure that the optimizer works well, so I believe that to improve the performance of the final simulator it is necessary to increase the expressivity of the model $(12)$.
To make a step ahead towards an acceptable solution, under the observations of Sextus Empiricus, now I want make an attempt where I increase the difficult of the estimation problem by relaxing the time-invariance hypothesis of the parameters. Thus, now I consider this more complicated model 
$$\tag{17}\begin{cases}
S_{t}&amp;=S_{t-1}-\alpha_t\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} \\ 
I_{t}&amp;=I_{t-1}+\alpha_t\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta_t I_{t-1}-\gamma_t I_{t-1} \\
R_{t}&amp;=R_{t-1}+\beta_t I_{t-1} \\
D_{t}&amp;=D_{t-1}+\gamma_t I_{t-1} \\
\end{cases} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$
The actual ""dynamic"" estimation problem can be solved by using a Kalman filter.

note: as mentioned by Sextus Empiricus, another possible approach to the problem is to tune the parameters by using the explicit solution of the SIRD model. I don't want follow this way because, as a student in control system engineering, I'm interested in learn how to identify generic dynamical systems in their implicit state-space representations. The SIRD problem is a ""toy example"" that I'm trying to resolve better as possible in my quarantine free-time.

$$\tag{18}\begin{cases} x_{t+1} &amp;= A_t x_t+w_t \\ y_t &amp;= C_t x_t+v_t \end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots$$
where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector, $y \in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the output vector of the system and the parameters $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $C \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}$ are matrices. The signals $w\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $v\in \mathbb{R}^p$ are white noises characterized respectively by null mean values and covariances $Q\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$  and $R\in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, i.e.
$$\begin{align} w_t &amp;= \text{wn}(0,Q_t) \\ v_t &amp;= \text{wn}(0,R_t) \end{align}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{19}$$



1.2 Kalman filter definition 

The Kalman filter is another dynamic system that estimates dynamically the state of the system $(18)$ by watching the model $(18)$ and a dataset $D\triangleq\{y_0, y_1, y_2, \dots\}$ of observed outputs. The estimation process is a recursion starting from the initial state $x_0$, that is unknown and modelled as a random variable with mean value $\hat{x_0}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and covariance $P_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, i.e.
$$\tag{20} x_0 \sim (\hat{x}_0, P_0)$$
At every time instant $t=1,2,3,\dots$ the recursion is splitted in two different steps:


correction: the filter computes the estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ of the state $x_t$ by considering all the observed past values $y_0,y_1, \dots, y_{t-1}$, summarized in a predicted estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$, and the actual observation $y_t$. Such estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ is characterized by the covariance $P_{t|t}$; 
prediction: the filter computes the estimate $\hat{x}_{t+1|t}$ of the state $x_{t+1}$ by considering the first equation of the model $(18)$. Such estimate $\hat{x}_{t+1|t}$ is characterized by the covariance $P_{t+1|t}$. 


the Kalman filter algorithm is the following
$$\boxed{\begin{align} 
\text{FOR}\quad &amp;t=1,2,3,\dots :\\
&amp;e_t \triangleq y_t - C_t \hat{x}_{t|t-1} \\
&amp;S_t \triangleq  C_t P_{t|t-1}C_t'+R_t \\
&amp;L_t \triangleq  P_{t|t-1}C_t' S_t ^{-1} \\
&amp;\text{1) correction}\\
&amp;\hat{x}_{t|t} \triangleq \hat{x}_{t|t-1}+L_t e_t \\
&amp;P_{t|t} \triangleq (I-L_t C_t)P_{t|t-1}(I-L_t C_t)'+L_t R_t L_t'\\
&amp;\text{2) prediction}\\
&amp;\hat{x}_{t+1|t} \triangleq A_t \hat{x}_{t|t}\\
&amp;P_{t+1|t} \triangleq A_t P_{t|t}A_t'+ Q_t
\end{align}}\tag{21}$$
note: if $x_0$, $w_t$, $v_\tau$, are gaussians and incorrelated for all the possible choices of $t, \tau$ then at every time istant $t$ the estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ is by definition the MMSE estimate of the state $x_t$, so the Kalman Filter finds the optimal estimation of the state $x_t$.

note: the signal $e_t$ is called innovation and it is the prediction error of the output of the system $(18)$ (since the predicted output generated by the Kalman filter is $\hat{y}_{t|t-1}=C_t \hat{x}_{t|t-1}$). Here the matrix $S_t$ is the covariance of the innovation (and not the number of susceptibles at time $t$, I hope that it is clear from the context when I'm talking about the innovation covariance or the number of susceptibles). The matrix $L_t$ is called correction gain since it is used to define the corrected estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$. The matrix $I$ is an identity matrix $n \times n$.

note: the initialization is $\hat{x}_{1|0}\triangleq \hat{x}_0$, $P_{1|0} \triangleq P_0$.



1.3 application to the SIRD estimation problem: static estimation

Before to jump in to the more general problem that involves the model $(17)$, I want to use the Kalman filter to make a more simpler ""static"" estimation of the parameters.
In order to use the Kalman filter, the idea is to define the following non-linear, time-variant, static system
$$\begin{cases}x_{t+1} &amp;=x_t+w_t \\
y_t &amp;=h_t(x_t)+v_t\end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{22}$$
where 
$$x_t \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    \alpha_t  \\ 
    \beta_t  \\  
    \gamma_t \\  
\end{bmatrix} \qquad 
y_t \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    S_t  \\ 
    I_t  \\  
    R_t \\  
    D_t 
\end{bmatrix} \qquad 
h_t(x_t) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    {S}_{t-1}-\frac{{S}_{t-1}{I}_{t-1}}{N}\alpha_t \\ 
    {I}_{t-1}-{I}_{t-1}\beta_t-{I}_t\gamma_t+\frac{{S}_{t-1}{I}_{t-1}}{N}\alpha_t  \\  
    {R}_{t-1}+{I}_{t-1}\beta_t \\  
    {D}_{t-1}+{I}_{t-1}\gamma_t 
\end{bmatrix} \\ \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{23}
$$
the system $(22)$ is not linear, so the idea to deal with this problem is to consider a simple linearization around the estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$of the output equation (like in an extended Kalman filter). 
$$y_t \approx h_t(\hat{x}_{t|t-1})+\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial x_t}\Bigg|_{x_t=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}}(x_t-\hat{x}_{t|t-1})+v_t \tag{24}$$
by defining the new coordinates
$$\tilde{y}_t \triangleq y_t-h_t(\hat{x}_{t|t-1}) \qquad \tilde{x}_t \triangleq x_t -\hat{x}_{t|t-1} \tag{25}$$
and the time-variant matrix
$$C_t \triangleq \frac{\partial h_t}{\partial x_t}\Bigg|_{x_t=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}}=\begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ 
    \phantom{-}\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1}  \\  
    0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; 0\\  
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \tag{26}$$
the system $(22)$ is approximated by the linear system
$$\begin{cases}\tilde{x}_{t+1} &amp;=\tilde{x}_t+w_t \\
\tilde{y}_t &amp;=C_t \tilde{x}_t+v_t\end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{27}$$
at this point it is possible to apply the Kalman filter $(21)$ to get an estimation for the parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$.



1.4 application to the SIRD estimation problem: dynamic estimation

In order to take into account the time dependency of the parameters it is sufficient to modify the first equation of the system $(22)$ in a suitable way that reflects approximately the real dynamic of the parameters
$$\begin{cases}x_{t+1} &amp;=f_t(x_t)+w_t \\
y_t &amp;=h_t(x_t)+v_t\end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{28}$$
in other words, the dynamic of the parameters $\alpha_t, \beta_t,\gamma_t$ is described by the motion model $f_t(x_t)$. To get an estimate of theese parameters it is possible to use an extended Kalman filter like in the previous section 1.3. 



2 My Questions

Before to writing down some code to get experimental responses, I'd like to have some suggestions about the previous dissertation. I have also two questions.


I'm not sure that $C_t$ is well defined. Let's assume that his definition $(26)$ is correct. Since the prediction model is $(14)$, that is a dynamic model, the quantities $\hat{S}_{t-1}$ and $\hat{I}_{t-1}$ are functions of all the previous predictions $\hat{y}_0 (\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}),\hat{y}_1 (\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}), \dots, \hat{y}_{t-2} (\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1})$. This means that at every time step the computational burden to get $C_t$ increase because it requires the simulation with the actual parameter $\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$ of the system $(12)$ up to time $t-2$ (that is increasing). It is possible to define a more efficient recursive formula to define $C_t$?
How can we define a reasonable motion model $f_t(x_t)$ that can take into account the observations made by Sextus Empiricus in the reply in my first thread?

",459081,"Nice write-up. I think eq#23 is not quite correct though. The observation $y_t$ should be a function of the state $x_t$ and noise $v_t$, like you said in eq#22 $y_t = h(x_t) + v_t$.

The issue with eq#23 is that $y_t$ depends on $y_{t-1}$. This would break the Markov assumption that $x_t$ is a sufficient state, which is foundational to the Kalman filter formulation.

I think the correct approach is to use
$$
x_t := \begin{bmatrix} S_t \\ I_t \\ R_t \\ D_t \\ \alpha_t \\ \beta_t \\ \gamma_t \end{bmatrix}
$$

This would be considered ""augmenting the state"" (SIRD) with the parameters ($\alpha$,$\beta$,$\gamma$) to do a ""joint-state-parameter"" estimation.

Your dynamic would be
$$
x_{t+1} =\begin{bmatrix}
    {S}_{t}-\frac{{S}_{t}{I}_{t}}{N}\alpha_t \\ 
    {I}_{t}-{I}_{t}\beta_t-{I}_t\gamma_t+\frac{{S}_{t}{I}_{t}}{N}\alpha_t  \\  
    {R}_{t}+{I}_{t}\beta_t \\  
    {D}_{t}+{I}_{t}\gamma_t \\ f_\alpha(x_t)\\f_\beta(x_t) \\ f_\gamma(x_t)
\end{bmatrix} + w_t
$$

You can treat the SIRD part of the dynamic as deterministic if you so desire by setting its entries of the covariance $Q_t$of $w_t$ to $0$, though that places all the uncertainty on the initial condition and parameters, which I don't think accurately reflects reality - the SIRD model isn't perfect even with best-fit parameters.

Your observation model would be the actual data, which we'd consider to be measurements of the SIRD part of the state, corrupted by noise (which you can remove by making its covariance $R_t \approx 0$ if you think the SIRD records are perfect).
$$
y_t = \begin{bmatrix} S_t \\ I_t \\ R_t \\ D_t \end{bmatrix} + v_t
$$

As for what you should design for $f_\alpha(x_t)$ and the other parameter dynamics, I think a random walk is fine (i.e. $f_\alpha(x_t) = \alpha_t$ so all the movement is due to the $\alpha$-component of $w_t$). But really I think designing a more sophisticated structure for that is a matter of studying epidemiology more. By creating a structured dynamic for the parameters, you are essentially making a more detailed model than what SIRD alone captures. Such an advanced design should probably be rooted in hard science, else it just becomes excess model capacity ripe for overfitting / poor generalization.

In other words, if you want a model for how the parameters would move, you should come up with an explanation / mechanism for why they would move. What do these parameters mean - what dynamical factors would influence them?

By the way, the selection of the noise covariances is pretty critical to the usefulness of the Kalman filter. If you are using them as tuning knobs rather than estimating them from data, you might as well just go back to your second approach (nonlinear regression of a multi-step predictor) and just use Gauss-Newton's method instead of gradient descent for optimization. The extended Kalman filter is essentially a covariance-weighted recursive application of Gauss-Newton least-squares.

",Accepted,"It sounds like you're trying to apply the intuitions of a hard-margin SVM to the results of a soft-margin SVM and being led astray by the differences.

I can tell you're using a soft-margin SVM because you provided a ""cost=10"" parameter; the e1071 R library does not appear to support a hard-margin classifier directly, but you can approximate it by using a suitably huge cost parameter, say 1e10.

When the cost is low, a soft-margin SVM will sometimes choose to misclassify one or more points if it means it can get a wider margin. Perhaps surprisingly, they may do this even when the data are truly linear separable and a ""perfect"" solution could be found. If you increase the cost to 100 or 1,000 it will behave more like the hard-margin version and you will see it correctly classify all training examples.

446785,An appropriate likelihood for reporting disease,"Wuhan flu is a very hot topic right now, and I have seen at least two papers and several bloggers attempt to model the $\mathcal{R}_0$ of the disease using the reported data on wikipedia.

The problem I have is that most of these approaches use a Guassian likelihood to get point estimates, and while that may be a good approximation, the uncertainty estimates would be more than wrong.  Consider for a moment that if there are $x$ reported cases of the flu then there can be more cases we have not seen, but not fewer.  The likelihood for any model should respect this property (that our observations can under estimate the true prevalence of the disease at a given time, but can not over estimate it).

What would be an appropriate likelihood for this process?  I imagine it would almost look like a flipped pareto distirbution. Interested in hearing your thoughts.
",446856,"Too early to fit models with $R_0$ (with only data about the number of infected people).

The larger problem is that the development is still in the exponential phase and we can not model the decrease of the exponential growth rate. See also this question: Fitting SIR model with 2019-nCoV data doesn&#39;t conververge In that framework (SIR model) the only variable that can be accurately determined is $\beta - \gamma$ but $R_0 = \beta/\gamma$ is still difficult to determine (but it seems to be $\beta-\gamma \approx 0.4 &gt; 0$ thus we at least know that $R_0&gt;1$).

See also the comment at the end of that answer about the use of only a time series in the number of infected people. That number does not provide a good measure of $R_0$, but it is auxiliary information that is being used. For instance direct estimates of $\gamma$ the parameter relating to how long people remain infectious (by observing how the virus has spread, rather than just using the quantitative numbers).



regarding your problem/question

Binomial distribution

One might model the reported cases as a binomial distributed variable. The observed/reported cases will be some fraction $p$ of the underlying real cases (in more advanced models this fraction could be variable depending on time and the number of cases). But the current data do not allow to study this (potentially one can fill in the gaps based on studies on a wider set of epidemical data). 

Given such situation (a binomial distributed fraction) one would expect that the variance is related to the mean by a factor between 0 and 1 (binomial distribution has $\mu = np$ and $var = npq$). However when we plot an exponential curve to the data then we currently get RSS being a factor 4 larger than the sum of means. Thus there is posibly overdispersion instead of underdispersion (although it is not yet a good accurate measure*).

*With so little data we can not be sure. In addition the model is not so great (as you say the approaches use simple Gaussian likelihood). One might use some correlation in the errors. I imagine that this is a potential source of overdispersion.

Poisson distribution for increments

There is new/recent an R package available on github that aims to model this specific epidemic:

https://rdrr.io/github/chrism0dwk/wuhan/

This model models an ODE according to a SEIR model and uses data that is separated for individual regions (combining this wit hthe population size in those regions and the transport in between those regions). 

The predictions from the model are compared with the observations by comparing the increments and assuming that these increments are Poisson distributed. 



Is there enough data?

The exponential model in the above graph does not fit accurately the data (although I would say the exponential fit is sufficient, still one might desire some more complex fit to learn more). One could make the fits more complex, possibly the factors that determine the dynamics are not constant in time. 

But, one may wonder what could be achieved by making the model more complex. I do not see what could be achieved. The data shows a reasonable exponential curve, and I do not believe that we should try to squeeze more out of the present data.

Potentially, one could incorporate more background information, and then some sort of simulations**, and a more Bayesian approach, could be interesting in order to project into the future what we could see (but this will lean mostly on prior information and those 12 data points do not provide a lot of information).

**Those simulations would also help to handle the correlations mentioned in the previous footnote.

Some interesting view of the data might be the distribution of the increases in the infections from day to day. This increase is not constant in time. We might better regard it as a variable with a random distribution by itself (and model variation in growth curves based on this random variation in the growth rate). Models to use are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion (the likelihood computation by Chris Jewell is also treating the evolution as a random walk by evaluating the observed 'step sizes/ increments')

",Reasonable,"Some hypotheses:


Scaling the data could improve the conditioning of the problem. See: In Machine learning, how does normalization help in convergence of gradient descent?
Training a neural network is hard in general; maybe a different configuration of hyperparameters (especially learning rate) would allow gradient descent to succeed. See: What should I do when my neural network doesn&#39;t learn?
Gradient descent isn't a very good optimizer; LM is way better. And we should hope that LM is better, because it's doing more work to find a good direction! So in this sense, it's not surprising that gradient descent doesn't do a great job compared to LM.

Here's a fun comparison of SGD and LM on a very simple problem:


  I bet a lot of you have tried training a deep net of your own from scratch and walked away feeling bad about yourself because you couldn’t get it to perform.
  
  I don’t think it’s your fault. I think it’s gradient descent’s fault. I’m going to run gradient descent on the simplest deep net you can imagine, a two layer deep net with linear activations and where the labels are a badly-conditioned linear function of the input.
  $$
\min_{W_1,W_2} \mathbb{E}_x \left\|W_1 W_2 x - Ax \right\|^2
$$





  Here, the condition number of $A$ is 1020. Gradient descent makes great progress early on, then spends the rest of the time making almost no progress at all. You might think this it’s hit a local minimum. It hasn’t. The gradients aren’t decaying to 0. You might say it’s hitting a statistical noise floor of the dataset. That’s not it either. I can compute the expectation of the loss and minimize it directly with gradient descent. Same thing happens. Gradient descent just slows down the closer it gets to a good answer. If you’ve ever trained Inception on ImageNet, you’ll know that gradient descent gets through this regime in a few hours, and takes days to crawl through this regime.
  
  The black line is what a better descent direction would do. This is Levenberg-Marquardt.
  
  If you haven’t tried optimizing this problem with gradient descent, please spend 10 minutes coding this up or try out this Jupyter notebook. This is the algorithm we use as our workhorse, and it fails on a completely benign non-contrived problem. You might say “this is a toy problem, gradient descent fits large models well.” First, everyone who raised their hands a minute ago would say otherwise. Secondly, this is how we build knowledge, we apply our tools to simple problems we can analyze, and work our way up in complexity. We seem to have just jumped our way up.

446912,Is there a model to predict mortality rate of an ongoing epidemic?,"Following the recent Coronavirus outbreak, various mortality rates have been published.

Most of these are simply the ratio between the deaths and the total verified cases, which is not a very accurate indicator as many of the verified cases are ongoing and could result in deaths.

I know some statistics from university but I am in no way an expert. I was wondering if there was any commonly used statistical model to predict with some accuracy the mortality rate of an ongoing epidemic. If there is, I'm guessing some of the variables would be the time between the onsetting of symptoms and death/healing for resolved cases.
",446923,"A natural (and perhaps naive) way to model mortality would be a binomial model, i.e.,

$$
x \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)
$$

Here $x$ is the number of deaths, $n$ is the total number of people infected, and $p$ is the mortality rate, or the probability of dying given that you have the disease. 
When we say something is distributed according to a binomial distribution, we mean that the observed counts $x$ are the result of $n$ independent trials, each with probability of ""success"" (in this case, death) $p$. These are usually termed ""Bernoulli trials"".

We can now examine the likelihood of $p$ given $x$ and $n$ -- i.e., how likely it would be to see the data we have observed, given different values of $p$. Imagine we had 100 cases, 50 of which resulted in deaths:

n &lt;- 100
x &lt;- 50
s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
plot(
  s, dbinom(x, size = n, prob = s), type=""l"",
  xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Binomial likelihood""
)




This shows that a point estimate (the maximum likelihood estimate) would be 0.5, which of course makes sense. Something important to consider here is the amount of data we have observed. Since we have a good amount of observations, the likelihood is fairly narrow. This means that there is a relatively small range of values for $p$ for which the data we observed would be likely to occur.

Now, imagine if we had only 10 cases, 5 of which resulted in deaths:

x &lt;- 5
n &lt;- 10
s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
plot(
  s, dbinom(x, size = n, prob = s), type=""l"",
  xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Binomial likelihood""
)




When we don't have much information, the likelihood is quite broad, indicating that the data would be fairly likely for a wide range of values for $p$.

It can be helpful in cases like this to incorporate a prior, or how likely we think different parameter values are, based on our existing knowledge. For example, imagine that we knew that the distribution of mortality rates across all known human diseases looked something like this:

s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
plot(
  s, dbeta(s, 32, 64), type=""l"",
  xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Proportion of diseases""
)




This is a Beta prior with $\alpha=32$ and $\beta=64$, i.e.,
$ p \sim \text{Beta}(32, 64)$.
We might want to use this prior information to guide our inferences about the mortality rate of a new disease for which we have very little information. We can combine this prior information with the likelihoods we've already plotted. If you want details about how this is done, one great starting point is this blog by David Robinson. Basically, the posterior distribution over our parameters is a Beta distribution. For parameters we take the $\alpha$ of our prior and add $x$, and take the $\beta$ of our prior and add $n-x$.

s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
n &lt;- 100
x &lt;- 50
plot(
  s, dbeta(s, shape1 = 32 + x, shape2 = 64 + n - x), 
  type=""l"", xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Posterior density""
)




As you can see, this prior information ""pulls"" our estimates downwards towards the distribution of existing mortality rates. However, if we had strong enough evidence (for example, thousands of infections and deaths) we could still produce an estimate outside of where the prior distribution is concentrated. When we have a small amount of data, a prior can be particularly helpful to avoid results that are purely the result of sampling noise - for example, imagine the first 10 people with a disease happen to die, and the next 90 survive. The estimate after 10 people would be 100%, which is extremely unlikely, given what we've seen about human disease in the past.

s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
n &lt;- 10
x &lt;- 5
plot(
  s, dbeta(s, shape1 = 32 + x, shape2 = 64 + n - x),
  type=""l"", xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Posterior density""
)




When we have very little data, this prior information really shrinks our estimates towards what we believe is a reasonable estimate of mortality, given what we've observed in the past about other diseases.

You can continually update this posterior distribution as new data comes in  by adding deaths to the $\alpha$ parameter and survivals to the $\beta$ parameter of the Beta distribution.

This is all just general; I have no real expertise in disease modelling. None of the parameters values I've chosen have any basis in reality.
",Reasonable,"Your requirements are not restrictive enough to determine some cases. For example, for these values:

f = [0,110,200,300,0]

how would you wish sim(d,f) and sim(e,g) to compare? What about sim(h,b) - would a Minkowski distance with p != 1 be any good for you? How about negative p?

However, you can try to construct a combined parametrised metric that satisfies your desired properties. You've already identified cosine similarity, manhattan similarity and normalisation to be useful. I'll give you an example in python, because it is as good as any language (or pseudolanguage) and it determines functions that otherwise might have more than one possible definition.

The basic principle is that one could use the metrics that have the desired properties, parametrise them, and finally weight them to achieve the desired balance. They need to be in the same domain, and because of cosine similarity I will bring all metrics in the [0,1] domain.

I'm not employing normalisation, because I don't see how it could add value to discern the given values. This might change, depending on other relationships you might wish to provide.

So an initial take could be this:

from math import atan, pi
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine, cityblock

a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
b = [0, 3, 6, 9, 0]
c = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
d = [0, 100, 200, 300, 0]
e = [0, 110, 210, 310, 0]

coef1 = 100

def man_derived(a, b):
    return (2 / pi) * atan(cityblock(a, b))

def bespoke_sim(a, b, p1):
    return (1 - cosine(a, b)) * (1 - man_derived(a, b))**p1

print(""sim(d,e)=%.5f""%bespoke_sim(d,e,coef1))
print(""sim(a,b)=%.5f""%bespoke_sim(a,b,coef1))
print(""sim(a,c)=%.5f""%bespoke_sim(a,c,coef1))
print(""sim(a,d)=%.5f""%bespoke_sim(a,d,coef1))
print(""sim(a,e)=%.5f""%bespoke_sim(a,e,coef1))


This results in:

sim(d,e)=0.88270
sim(a,b)=0.99565
sim(a,c)=0.71714
sim(a,d)=0.10168
sim(a,e)=0.09702


This gives you a desired order of the other elements, except for sim(d,e), but as I already indicated, I am not sure what logic should lead this to be larger then sim(a,e).

In general I hope you can see the thinking: Metrics are combined by multiplication, because this keeps them in the [0,1] domain. Parameters (in the example this is p2)are used to weight individual metrics by rising them to a higher multiplicative power.

Also, you didn't want to limit your domain, but obviously one event has different implications when one of few, and when one of many. Then what is many - 100, 1 million, more? In my formula this comes into play with the atan function.

448320,Coronavirus growth rate and its possibly spurious resemblance to vapor pressure model,"I collected the latest data on the coronavirus from Johns Hopkins University as shown and fitted different curves to this data to model the relationship between the number of confirmed patients $P$ who are/were infected as function of time $T$ taking 20-Jan-20 as day 1.





As opposed to applying the standard SIR and SEIR I tried out simple curve fitting to see the general trend. The curve fitting software I used has well known models form different branches of science as well as we could build our own custom models which I did as shown in the image below. The score against the name of a model gives how well a model fits this data. The higher the score, the better the fit and the maximum possible score is 1000. Although we have data only for 18 days (as of 7-Feb 2 AM GMT) one model always kept appearing at top as the best fit and this was the vapor pressure model. After checking for various boundary conditions, I rejected many of models but I could not find any immediately reason to reject the vapor pressure model. Similarly when I modeled the number of reported deaths against time, the vapor pressure model once again gave the best fit which for which I could not find any obvious reasons to reject.



So I did some research on the vapor pressure model.

Basic concept of vapor pressure Because the molecules of a liquid $L$ are in constant motion and possess kinetic energies, at any moment some fraction of them has enough energy to escape from the surface of the liquid to enter the gas phase. This process, called evaporation, generates a vapor pressure $P_L$ above the liquid. Molecules in the gas phase can collide with the liquid surface and reenter the liquid via condensation. Eventually, a steady state is reached in which the number of molecules evaporating and condensing per unit time is the same, and the system is in a state of dynamic equilibrium. Under these conditions, a liquid exhibits a characteristic equilibrium vapor pressure that depends only on the temperature $T_L$. Volatile liquids are liquids with high vapor pressures, which tend to evaporate readily from an open container; nonvolatile liquids have low vapor pressures. When the vapor pressure equals the external pressure, bubbles of vapor form within the liquid, and it boils. We can express the nonlinear relationship between vapor pressure and temperature as an almost linear relationship using the Antoine equation. 

$$
P_L = exp\Big(a + \frac{b}{T_L} + c\log T_L\Big)
$$

Next I did some research what is known about how the coronavirus spreads and if it is related to liquids. Here is what I found. 


  How coronavirus spreads: When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they shed droplets of saliva, mucus, or other bodily fluids. If any of those droplets fall on you—or if you touch them and then, say, touch your face—you can become infected as well. Hospital for communicable diseases define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person for 10 minutes or longer. Time and distance matters.


The coronavirus spreads when it escapes from an infected person through microscopic droplets of liquid carrying the virus through air. I wonder this has anything to do with why the vapor pressure model keeps coming on the top as the best fit even though there is no apparent pressure or temperature as in the vapor pressure equation and I cannot see how they could be elated. May be all this just a mere coincidence. 


  As a bad scientist but a concerned human, I thought I must report this
  observation in case there is anything worth in it.


Question: Given this limited data what can we infer about the corona virus growth rate and how can we reject the vapor pressure model as a mere spurious correlation.

Note 1: I am well aware of spurious correlation. But with only 3 weeks of data, we many not be able to detect a different trend this early. Hence I am reporting the best fit regardless.

The dataset you have is small, possibly underrepresented, and of unknown quality, since it is argued that many cases could have not been diagnosed. You observe an exponential growth, a common phenomena in many natural and artificial processes. The curve fits well, but  I'd bet that other similar curves would also fit well.

Notice that the the Antoine equation mentioned by you, is a very flexible one, since it can account for constant ($\alpha$), exponential ($b/T_L$), and linear ($c\log T_L$) growth curves. This makes it easy to fit to many datasets.

Moreover, with this kind of data, it may be harder to model it at early stages. Notice that you could fit a linear growth model to the earliest period. Later, quadratic may fit just fine. Later, exponential would fit better, where the exact rate may be hard to catch, since by definition ""the more it grows, then the more it grows"", and it may easy speed up quite rapidly.

453791,"How could one (tentatively) estimate the actual number of COVID-19 infections in an area, using hard data like age-adjusted death rate?","A big problem with the current COVID-19 epidemic is the difficulty of getting tested (due to mild symptoms and lack of testing kits). This makes it impossible for patients with little or no symptoms to know how likely it is to be infected and further spreading the disease. 

There are estimations available but only take into account confirmed cases (and range between 10x-1000x of this number). How could one get estimations of the number of patients by using secondary features of the distribution that could be more robust? Age-adjusted death rate under intensive care could be one of several such parameters.


",453878,"Death rate

Using death rate may work when people that die have most likely acquired the virus locally. 

However, for the moment, many people die because they acquired the virus during a visit to another area, or because they got it from another person that acquired the virus abroad. 

Thus this death-rate based number is not very accurate unless the virus has fully spread out (in which case it will be more likely to get infected from a local source). 

For the cases of Wuhan, Italy and other epi-centers, which have more spread due to local infections rather than foreign infections, death rate might be a good probe (although you still have to deal with the delay).

In addition, while death rate might be more thrustworthy than total cases of infection (just think about the Germans, with lots of supplies, are testing with a lot of thousands people, while neighboring countries, with limited supplies, are trying to limit the use of testing as much as possible), bit it is still a biased number. It is not easy to determine/pinpoint the cause of death. Often multitude of diseases are present. If a person with cancer or aids gets a pneumonia from nCoV-19, then what is the cause? The sampling of 'cause of death' is not very clear and becomes part of the analysis.

Statistics are only usefull for a comparison when they have a similar underlying basis. 

Travel data

The virus is mostly spreading out irregularly over a network. It spreads out differently at different scales, within the household, neighborhood, workplaces/schools, villages, agglomerations, countries, continents.  You can sort of see the virus spread around with sudden jumps from large node/community to large node/community. 

You can use occurrence of the virus in those nodes/communities as the variable (so you do not count individuals, since we do not know the presence in all individuals, but instead count the much better known presence of the virus in communities), and then use a model for the dynamics of the virus spreading between this different nodes in the network.

For instance. E.g. in region A you encounter x cases of disease among people that came from region B and y cases of disease among people that came from region C, while the travel to those regions is $r$ and $q$, then an estimate of the relative presence of the virus in regions B:C can be approximated by (x/r):(y/q).

I remember there was an early article on the spread of COVID-19 (I believe it was by Chinese scholars) that tried to estimate $R_0$ and included information about the frequency of travel between different regions.



Random tests

You can perform test on a sample from the population that does not show any symptoms and use the prevalence of the virus among this sample to make an estimate about the prevalence in the entire population.

If the prevalence is very small then this requires a very large sample which might be difficult. In that case one may perform the test among a sample where the suspicion of the prevalence is higher and gain some information about how many people have the virus in that group. Such a measure can be used to calibrate the estimates based on incomplete information (ie. along with other information, such as the rate at which people with the virus have the particular mild or severe symptoms, you get an idea about how much the current estimates are underestimating the true number of cases).
",Reasonable,"I think this might be how to think of it :

Rewrite the concentration inequality as 

$$

then

$$
\mathbb{P} \bigg( \lvert  X - E[X] \rvert \geq \eta^{-\frac{1}{4}} \sigma C_4^\frac{1}{4} \bigg) \leq \eta
$$

then if you removed the $\eta$-quantile, the remaining $1-\eta$ mass of points would lie within

453879,How to correctly analyze fatality rate and daily deaths of Chinese and Italian COVID-19 outbreak?,"This is a strange case of difference in fatality rate between Chinese and Italian covid-19 outbreak.

In my knowledge, fatality rate is a ratio between deaths from a certain disease compared to the total number of subjects diagnosed with the disease.

Starting from this assumption, I attempted to analyze difference in fatality rate between Chinese/Italian outbreak. Herein, I propose a reproducible R example for exploring this variable:

# Import dataset from authoritative source:

From this basis, I'm a little bit confused about such difference in terms of fatality rate between the two analyzed countries. In fact, China has the maximum fatality rate at 4%, while Italy at more than 6%. For this reason I've two questions:

1) Is my computation correct?

2) If yes, why such a huge difference in terms of fatality rate? 



EDT II

I would like to improve this question reporting a recent Science paper which can partially explain these differences. In fact, Li et al reported that for each COVID+ patient, other 5-10 are undocumented COVID+ leading to missleading fatality rate. Moreover, as reported in the comments, to date, there are no univocal diagnostic methods wordwide.
However, Italy is experiencing a huge increment in daily cumulative deaths compered to China:

Something is happening there! Hubei province is almost similar to Italy in terms of surface and population but very different in terms of population mean age since Italy is one of the oldest EU country.
",453882,"Reason 1 something technical about the computation.

Dying occurs with some delay to getting sick. As a consequence the ratio of people that got sick and the people that have died, is not equal to the ratio of people that will die.

(Still, if the number of sick cases and death cases both grow exponentially with the same factor then you might still expect this number to remain constant, but keep in mind that the growth is not exponential and that it is only a simplified model)



Reason 2 something important about the data acquisition

You might say, ok then let's compare the number of death cases with the number of sick several days ago (according to the average number that it takes between getting sick and dying).

But, the most important reason why the death rate based on these statistics is not constant and not comparible is because those numbers are only the reported cases and those may be a lot less than the real cases. So you are not computing a real death rate.

The statistic (reported/confirmed cases) is not what you think that it is (number of cases). This is especially clear in the curve of cases for China which has a bump because the number of cases rapidly increased after the defenitions were changed (from positively tested people to people with clinical symptoms)
",Reasonable,"Note in your wikipedia definition of case fatality rate, you NEED to know the eventual outcome of all individuals infected with disease. As they note, of the 100, 9 die, and 91 recover, they do not live with infection. Your data do not show the number who recovered from disease. If the lag between confirmed case and death is long, you underestimated CFR. CFR can also be biased by the number of unconfirmed cases who die from disease and are confirmed as cases based on cause of death.

Questions I understand that if the logistic model had been good, the next point should have been in the confidence range with a probability of 90% (or 95%). Can I conclude that the logistic model is not a good model here? Are there some standard procedures to assess the validity of the prediction by taking into account the uncertainty on the model?

Also, the difference between the two asymptotes gives me an indication of the precision of the prediction (it is not off by 1 or by 10^5 but by about 500 deaths). Is there some classic methods to take this into account?

Edit 21/03/2020: clarification in response to hakan's answer

The model I fitted is 
$$\dfrac{c}{1 + a e^{-b x}}$$
and with $a=514434$, $b=-0.276$ and $c=5568$. Of course, this model is the same as @hakanc's, with a different parametrization (e.g. his $K$ corresponds to my $c$). The corresponding covariance matrix is
$$\begin{bmatrix} 1.1\times 10^{10}&amp; 641 &amp; -2.5\times 10^7 \\ \star &amp; 3.8\times 10^{-5} &amp; -1.6\\ \star &amp; \star &amp; 80\times 10^3 \end{bmatrix}$$

I believe the low sensitivity to $c$ ($=K$) is described by the $(3,3)$ component of the covariance matrix, $\sigma=\sqrt{80\times 10^3}\approx 280$. So though I understand (and agree with) the argument of low sensitivity, I believe it is already included in the ""confidence band"".
",454917,"When working with mathematical models, it is always good to check the assumptions of the model. The logistic function is often used when modelling population growth, and specifically where the rate of reproduction is proportional to both the existing population and the amount of available resources, all else being equal. Letting $P$ represent population size, the differential equation is 

$$
{\displaystyle {\frac {dP}{dt}}=rP\cdot \left(1-{\frac {P}{K}}\right),}
$$
where the constant $r$ defines the growth rate and $K$ is the carrying capacity, see the link for more details. The solution, letting $P_0$ be the initial population, is
$$
P(t)={\frac {KP_{0}e^{rt}}{K+P_{0}\left(e^{rt}-1\right)}}
$$
Thus, this model would be appropriate if Italy did nothing to mitigate the spread of the virus, but they are in fact using quarantine. The effect of wrong modelling assumptions would be that if you cross-validated the fitted model, you would get poor results. 

Additionally, since the shape of the logistic function is 



and in your data, it does not seem to include the part where the curve flattens out, I would suspect that the parameter describing that phenomenon, $K$, would have a high variance from your estimation procedure. An intuitive explanation for this can be done by plotting the function for different $K$ and constant $r$:



In this figure, if there is only data for $t$ between 0 and 1 would not reveal so much information on $K$, other than if $K$ is around 10, compared to $K &gt; 100$. More formally, assuming you are doing maximum likelihood estimation, you can look at the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the corresponding likelihood function, to see if optimization problem is well conditioned. 
",Reasonable,"It is generally inappropriate to leave out the components of an interaction term in a regression.

At the very least you should include a plain ""temperature"" term in your model.  Whichever dummy variable you leave out is your reference category.  So b2 should be the effect of temperature in February relative to January.  But without the uninteracted temperature term, your model does not allow temperature to have any effect in January.

Can anything useful be said about the prevalence of the virus in California based on these results? If (a) the 11500 tests were from randomly chosen Californians and (b) the tests were of ""gold standard"" quality, then prevalence would be close to $1206/11500 =  0.1049 \approx 10.5\%.$

However, according to the Chronicle article, guidelines have centered on testing people showing symptoms of COVID-19 disease, care workers who have had contact with COVID-19 patients, and people who have symptoms of pneumonia, but test negative for pneumonia.

In my answer below, I will extend my answer to this question to give prevalence values resulting from various assumptions about the sensitivity and specificity of the tests involved. I use the notation of that page. This analysis may help to answer the question for whatever population produced the specimens tested.

Additional answers are welcome, perhaps showing alternative methods or based on
additional information that may become available as the pandemic
continues
",455133,"Notation. Let $\pi = P(\text{Disease})$ be the prevalence of the disease in the population and $\tau = P(\text{Pos Test})$ be the proportion testing positive. For the test, let
$\eta = P(\text{Pos}|\text{Disease})$ be the sensitivity and
$\theta = P(\text{Neg}|\text{No Disease})$ be its specificity. Also, given test results, let 
$\gamma =  P(\text{Disease}| \text{Pos})$ and 
$\delta =  P(\text{No Disease}| \text{Neg})$ be, respectively, the predictive powers of a positive or negative test.

If a test is of gold standard quality with $\eta = \theta = 1,$ then $\pi = \tau.$ Tests that accurately sequence the genome of the virus may be gold standard tests. Often the first tests for a virus may have considerably lower values of $\eta$ and $\theta.$ It is difficult to find accounts of values of $\eta$ and $\theta$ for any of the tests in current use for COVID-19. (According to one unauthorized report, a test used in China had $\theta \approx 0.7.)$

Traditional estimate. First, we look at results for tests with $\eta = \theta = 0.95.$ Then for data with $n= 11\,500; a = 1206,$ we have $\hat \tau = t = 0.1049.$ The associated 95% Wald confidence interval for $\tau$ is $(0.0993, 0.1105)$
from which one can derive the confidence interval
$(0.0547, 0.0672)$ for $\pi.$ Also, $\pi = 0.061$ implies that the predictive power of a positive test is $\gamma = 0.5523.$ Only about half of the subjects testing positive are actually infected.
Some computations in R follow:

ETA = THETA = .95
n = 11500;  a = 1206;  p0m = -1:1; t = a/n
wald.TAU = t +p0m*1.96*sqrt(t*(1-t)/n);  wald.TAU

[1] 0.06096618
GAMMA = PI*ETA/(PI*ETA + (1-PI)*(1-THETA)); GAMMA
[1] 0.5522849


When the traditional estimate is problematic. For a poorer test with $\eta = \theta = 0.90,$ this method gives a CI for $\pi$ 
as $(-0.0009, 0.0131),$ which has a (nonsensical) negative left endpoint. (We would expect about 1150 false positive tests even with no infected subjects. This is getting close to the the observed number 1206 of positive tests.) In such circumstances, one wonders whether to trust the point estimates $\hat \pi = 0.0061$ and $\hat \gamma = 0.0522.$

ETA = THETA = .9

A Gibbs sampler. One useful alternative approach is to assume a beta prior distribution on prevalence $\pi \sim \mathsf{Beta(\alpha, \beta)}.$ Even if noninformative with $\alpha = \beta = 0.5,$ such a prior distribution excludes value of $\pi$ outside $(0,1).$
Then we use a Gibbs sampler to find the posterior distribution of $\pi,$ given our data $n = 11\,500, a = 1206.$ Its steps, within each iteration, are as follows:


We begin with an arbitrary value of $\pi_1 \in (0,1)$ and use it to estimate 'latent' counts of subjects with the disease based on predictive values $\gamma$ and $\delta.$ We sample counts $X \sim \mathsf{Binom}(a, \gamma)$ and $Y \sim \mathsf{Binom}(n-A, 1 - \delta).$
Then with the estimated $S = X+Y$ infected subjects, we update the beta prior at this step as $\pi|S \sim \mathsf{BETA}(\alpha + S, \beta + n - S).$ Finally, we sample $\pi_2$ from this updated distribution. Even with arbitrary $\pi_1,$ this new value $\pi_2$ is likely to be closer to the truth.


Simulated posterior distribution. Iterating through many such steps we get successive values $\pi_1, \pi_2, \pi_3, \dots ,$
in a convergent Markov chain, for which the limiting distribution is the desired posterior distribution of the prevalence. To make sure that the chain has reached steady state, we
use only the last half of the many values $\pi_i$ generated in this way.

Because the two-sided Bayesian probability interval $(.00003, .0123)$ has its lower endpoint so near to 0, we also look at the one-sided interval $(0, .0110)$ for $\pi.$  

Because we estimate the predictive power $\gamma$ of a positive test at each step of the chain, we capture its values in order to get a 95\% Bayesian probability interval $(0.0003, 0.1005)$ for the predictive power $\gamma$ of a positive test. If we were to sequester subjects that get a positive result with this test, then only a relatively small proportion of sequestered subjects would actually be infected.

Diagnostic Plots. Not all Gibbs samplers converge as
anticipated. Diagnostic plots show that this one does. 


A plot of successive values of $\pi$ shows the nature of the convergence of the Markov chain. The history plot of $\pi$ shows that the chain 'mixes well'; that is, it moves freely among appropriate values. There are no points of
near-absorption. 
The trace of running averages of the $\pi_i$ shows smooth convergence to prevalence 0.0049.
Vertical blue lines indicate the burn-in period.
The ACF plot shows that the $\pi_i$ are not independent. Among the $m = 100\,000$ values, perhaps there are 1000
independent ones. In many Gibbs samplers, Markov dependence 'wears away' more rapidly than here. 
The plot at lower-right is a history plot of the $\gamma_i.$ 




Variations. If we run the same program with $\eta = \theta = .95,$ results are nearly the same as for the traditional procedure. If we have useful prior information (or opinions) about the prevalence, we can incorporate that information into the prior distribution on $\pi.$

With sampsize you tell the model how many units to sample from each class. It is called with sampsize=c('0'=10,'1'=20) which means 10 units from the class '0' and 20 units from the class '1' (if you use different labels for the classes then change accordingly). With replace=T you tell the model to sample with replacement. So in this case it will sample 10 units from class 0 with replacement.

457408,Can stats regarding the Coronavirus outbreak tell us anything at all?,"Everywhere in the news we hear about numbers of corona-virus infections, deaths and recoveries.

In lots of the publications the numbers (especially the infections) are compared with previous days. Mostly the presented numbers are 'growth' of new infections in per cent and the total number of infections so far. Then the numbers of different countries are shown. 

I tried to get something out of these numbers (of infections) and realized that some important information is not told: the amount of tests done. And even further, who is tested? Which criteria? And this varies a lot between countries. Then there is the accuracy of tests. 

The number and kind of tests done everyday change as well as more capacity is created or less capacity is available due to overloads or work restrictions.

I told myself the amount of deaths, as horrible as it sounds, is a good indicator of stabilization or regression. But no, people are not effected the same way regarding their previous medical condition. At some point in time, people at risk will ""disappear"" (again sorry for the word-choice).

I have the feeling that there so many variables and factors we are not able to gather regarding this pandemic (at least currently) that statistics are at their limit. Announced trends are most likely wrong. 

How sure can we be about statistics in the current situation? Are trends viable? What can be compared what not? Is all current information foundationless?
",457428,"Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good

Many of the issues you have raised are perfectly reasonable concerns.  Having said that, it is important to distinguish between cases where reported data is wrong, versus cases where reported data is correct, but is limited in its usage due to the omission of other relevant information.  The latter case is really quite ubiquitous in statistical analysis, since it is very rare that we have all the data we would ideally like to have.  In such circumstances, it is also important not to make the perfect the enemy of the good by presuming that the absence of a comprehensive dataset on every variable we would like to know about precludes any reasonable inferences being made from the data we have.

The main comprehensive public dataset we have available for the COVID-19 virus is the data held and updated by the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre at John Hopkins University.  This is the repository of data that is being used for the vast majority of media reports and data visualisations on the spread of COVID-19.  The database has data on confirmed infections, recoveries, and deaths, plus GIS data on where these occurred.  The data is sourced from the WHO and various national health departments, and it is being updated frequently.

It is certainly true that there are a lot of other things we would ideally like to have data about, to assist in understanding the path and severity of the virus.  As you have suggested, it would be wonderful if we could also obtaina comprehensive dataset on all the tests that have actually been conducted (including the negative results), and the characteristics of all the affected patients, including their age, sex, and health factors.   At this early stage it is probably overly ambitious to expect all of this data to have been collected and collated, but hopefully the various health departments of the world will eventually be able to bring some of this data together.  Health departments cannot legally disclose health information on particular patients in a way that would make them identifiable, so it is an extremely complex task to collate this type of data if the goal is to make it available for public analysis.  No doubt there will be some efforts to obtain and collate more detailed data, but it will be a difficult task.

When interpreting limited data, it is desirable to describe that data in a way that makes it clear how it was collected, and this collection mechanism forms a caveat on analysis.  Thus, we can refer to the reported numbers of infections, recoveries, deaths, etc., from each of the reporting countries, while noting that there may be disparities from these figures to the actual true numbers.  Most health departments around the world are set up so that they can obtain these figures with reasonable accuracy, so that large diparities between reported figures and the true values are unlikely, except in the case of countries that make a deliberate effort to suppress this information.  Notwithstanding the lack of the ideal data you would like, from the reported data there are certainly some things that we can reasonably infer.  For most countries, the data is likely to be a reasonably representation of the number of infected, recovered, and dead patients out of those who have been properly tested.  (Of course, I take some of the data, such as the recent numbers from China, with a large degree of scepticism.)  It is also likely that there are other infected and recovered people who have not been tested, and who therefore do not form part of the reported statistics.  Even so, this data gives us a pretty good look at growth rates for the infection in various cities and countries around the world, which allows us to see where the virus has progresssed most rapidly, and where it has been relatively contained.  These numbers also allow some attempt at extrapolation, which allows health authorities to make predictions on the likely number of cases at future dates, and the health burden this will create in different places.

Your question appears to assert that most of these trends are likely to be ""wrong"" due to the absence of data on other factors such as total testing and patient health.  In my view, that is not the correct way to look at it.  Rather, the reported trends may be correct, in the limited descriptive sense, but there may still be underlying non-reported factors that would give reason to anticipate future changes in those trends.  Personally, I am extremely impressed at how rapidly these various organisations have coordinated a large data collation and made public online platforms reporting on the infection and updating it frequently.  I can log on every day and see updated graphical information showing the progression of the infection in virtually any city or country in the world!  The data may not be perfect, but I would think it would bear enough of a resemblance to reality to be valuable information.  I think the effort is quite amazing, and it far past what we could do even ten years ago.

Point forecasting stock returns is notoriously difficult, so I would not expect much success with that regardless of what model you choose.

459166,Where does the logistic function come from?,"I first learned the logistic function in machine learning course, where it is just a function that map a real number to 0 to 1. We can use calculus to get its derivative and use the derivative for some optimization tasks.

Later, I learned it in statistic literature where there are log odds and bunch of probabilistic interpretations. 

Today I am reviewing some differential equation literature, and found the logistic function is a solution for the following system:

$y'=y(1-y)$, and $y(0)=0.5$.



So, my question is more like a ""chicken and egg"" problem: where does the logistic function come from? Do we first have the function or the ODE?
",459180,"I read from Strogatz's book that it was originated from modeling the human populations by Verhulst in 1838. Assume the population size is $N(t)$, then the per capita growth rate is $\dot N(t)/N(t)$. By assuming the per capita growth rate descreases linearly with the population size, we can have the logistic equation of following form:
$$\dot N(t)=rN(1-\frac{N}{K}),$$
where $K$ is carrying capacity of the environment. From the equation, we can see that when $N$ is very small, the population grows approximately exponentially. As $N$ grows until half of the capacity, the derivative $\dot N$ is still increasing but slows down. Once $N$ passes the half line, the derivative decreases so we can see a bending curve (we can see this actually from Coronavirus cases) and the population asymptotically approaches the capacity. Up to this point, we observe the properties of a logistic function. Intuitively, when $N$ is larger the capacity, the population decreases. By further mathematical simplification of the equation, we have an equation like this:
$$\frac{df(x)}{dx}=f(x)(1-f(x)),$$
which has analytical solotion as:
$$f(x)=\frac{e^x}{e^x + C}.$$
With $C=1$ we have the logistic function.
",Reasonable,"What you're thinking of is doing a t-test when the variance is unknown instead of a z-test when the variance is known. If you know the variance, it's better to use the z-test. However, it sounds like you want to say that, since you have such a tight estimate of the standard deviation when you have many observations, you can say that you have the population parameter pinned down.

Well...even then, you don't actually know the population variance. Howeer, the t-test takes care of this internally. As you increase the degrees of freedom for the t-distribution by having a larger and larger sample size, the t-distribution converges to N(0,1). For a large sample size when you almost know the population variance, you're almost doing the z-test.

459501,A smaller dataset is better: Is this statement false in statistics? How to refute it properly?,"Dr. Raoult, who promotes Hydroxychloroquine, has some really intriguing statement about statistics in the biomedical field:


  It's counterintuitive, but the smaller the sample size of a clinical test, the more significant its results are. The differences in a sample of 20 people may be more significant than in a sample of 10,000 people. If we need such a sample, there is a risk of being wrong. With 10,000 people, when the differences are small, sometimes they don't exist. 


Is this a false statement in statistics? If so, is it therefore also false in the Biomedical field? On which basis can we refute it properly, by a confidence interval?

Dr. Raoult promotes Hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid-19, thanks to an article about a study on 24 patients. His claims have been repeated a lot because of for this study, but mainly in the mainstream media, not in the scientific press.

In machine learning, the SciKit workflow states that before choosing any model, you NEED a dataset with at least 50 samples, whether it be for a simple regression, or the most advance clustering technique, etc., which is why I find this statement really intriguing.



EDIT: some of the answers below make the assumption of no result bias. They deal with the concept of power and effect size.
However it seems there is a bias in Dr. Raoult data. The most striking being removing data for the dead, for the reason they could not provide data for the entire duration of the study.  

My question remains however focused on the impact of using a small sample size.

Reference to the scientific paper in question.

",459587,"I agree with many of the other answers here but think the statement is even worse than they make it out to be. 

The statement is an explicit version of an implicit claim in many shoddy analyses of small datasets. These hint that because they have found a significant result in a small sample, their claimed result must be real and important because it is 'harder' to find a significant effect in a small sample. This belief is simply wrong, because random error in small samples means that any result is less trustworthy, whether the effect size is large or small. Large and significant effects are therefore more likely to be of the incorrect magnitude and more importantly, they can be in the wrong direction. Andrew Gelman refers to these usefully as 'Type S' errors (estimates whose sign is wrong) as opposed to 'Type M' errors (estimates whose magnitude is wrong). Combine this with the file-drawer effect (small, non-significant results go unpublished, while large, significant ones are published) and you are most of the way to the replication crisis and a lot of wasted time, effort and money. 

Thanks to @Adrian below for digging up a figure from Gelman that illustrates this point well: 



This may seem to be an extreme example but the point is entirely relevant to the argument made by Raoult. 
",Reasonable,"Yes, a smaller sample CAN be more informative due to the confluence of similar significant discriminating attributes. For example, a small sample of Detriot African Americans with similar income levels and associated access to healthcare, occupations, stress, diets and pre-existing conditions (high blood pressure,...) is better than a 100,000 sample of Americans where the confluence of these attributes is rare.

This is a problem in model design and conformity of the data to underlying assumptions of independence and identically distributed.

More is not always better, my field experience confirms 'garbage in' does result in 'garbage out', where increasing the sample size is not a solution nor is postulating explanatory variables after seeing the data!

But, professional scientists don't have much time for long discussions. I think this is also the reason the Q&amp;A format attracts much more then bulletin boards or formerly newsgroups.

So the best option you might have to discuss with experts on your topics online are virtual conferences where maybe a chat or comment app is attached to each talk.

My co-organizers and I are debating on a plan for what to do if the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States worsens. Right now, most of the participants are from states with no confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but this may change rapidly as the situation develops between now and the conference.

This is an issue other conferences throughout history have surely had to deal with, so I wanted to ask StackExchange if there were any best practices around for dealing with an issue like this. Some questions:


How far out should the go/no go decision be made? If the conference is late April, should we be planning to let participants and speakers know by early April so they can cancel flights and so on?
What criteria should best inform whether we cancel or not? Number of cases in the participants' states for instance?
In the event we are to cancel the conference, how can we still give the speakers a chance to advertise their results? Have there been successful ""video conferences"" before where the organizers collect video for each talk and then upload them and participants can make comments? 

",145100,"Regarding remote conferences, these have been successful. Often the motivating factor has been mitigating climate impact. For example, Yale Climate Connections wrote an article giving advice for running virtual conferences. Author Sara Peach presents three kinds of virtual conferencing, all of which have been done successfully: 


remote presentations in a traditional conference format. If people choose to not travel, they can still remote in or follow the session on social media. (Example: AGU)
hub-based conference, where people gather in regional clusters. Each hub has some of its own content but are able to watch each other's presentations. (Example: International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition)
an entirely remote conference, where people record and upload videos of presentations and conferencegoers have weeks to ask questions and interact. (Example: A Nearly Carbon-Neutral Conference Model)


I'll add that an entirely virtual synchronous conference has also been done successfully. One example is NACADA, the Global Community for Academic Advising, which ran a 24-hour live-streaming virtual conference. 

The mixed-conference or hub models may or may not be feasible, since they would still involve people gathering in some models, and you aren't sure yet whether that will be feasible on any scale. Also, developing regional hubs would take time you don't have.  Thus, if you decide to go entirely virtual, a synchronous-with-live-streaming conference and a asynchronous recorded approach have been done, and the resources linked should provide a way to start researching or planning that model. I also advise contacting your own IT department about the possibility.

To find such an opportunity I'd suggest the following steps. Your local library has a need to re-bind books and knows who does that. Find out the contact information for such a service and, starting with them, work up the chain of contacts to the people who do the actual production. 

Other than librarians, you could also talk to a book-rep who visits your school or at an academic conference. Again, work up the chain of contacts to the production department. 

There are a number of presses in the US who do custom small editions for authors and others. Thorndike Press in Maine used to be one of those, but I don't know if they still do it. But there are others. Search for Custom Publishing. But they may use suppliers of services and you will need to work to find who actually does the work. You are looking for, and may find, a company that actually uses hand crafting to bind books and even those that design the bindings using non-standard materials. 

If you can find a really high quality book production outfit, you might explore either an internship or an apprenticeship with one of them. It might be paid or not. But even an entry level regular position will give you an opportunity to learn the skills. 

Another source, but harder to find, are individual artisans who design and manufacture their own books (poetry, art, ...). I met one within the past year at a craft fair. But a search for ""hand made books"" might turn up something.

145370,Tips for transition to online classrooms given university shutdowns in response to COVID-19,"Given the recent shutdowns of many universities across the world, there's an increased interest in online education techniques.

In my case, I am a TA for a quantum chemistry class, and I'm finding it daunting to transition to online teaching. At first, I got really excited because I thought of taking advantage of this situation to run a flipped discussion section: I'd record lectures in advance, and then have virtual office hours where students could Zoom/Skype/Google hangout with me and we discuss in the same chatroom (so everyone hears the conversation). 

However, in what I suspect to be an attempt to distance themselves from something nice and free/far cheaper (like edX) which has been doing this online routine for a long time, my university has required that we livestream our lectures/discussion sections. This is purportedly to be in the aim to make their online experience as college-like as possible, but it's problematic for multiple reasons. First, lectures are at 9AM EST... Do we expect students to tune in at 10 PM in Japan? Or 3 AM in Hawaii? 

Second, we should use the silver linings present in this university shutdown: video lectures = students get to go back and re-listen to a part that confused them! From my perspective, this university requirement goes against an attempt to maintain normalcy: normalcy should not be defined as continuation of the same daily routine (impossible for many), but rather a continuation of helpful instruction.

I intend to find out whom to email about this, but in the meantime, what resources/advice would you suggest for an instructor who suddenly has to transition to the digital classroom?
",145371,"This is marked for community ownership so constructive edits will be welcomed. It is, however, more directed at those who can design a course, rather than a TA who has limited control. 

Background

Many of the teaching techniques we use are not optimal for learning. They have been designed for economic efficiency since they scale. Some of them have been a bit obsolete since the creation of the internet. But face to face classes in real time are no longer necessary. Lecture is efficient (one teacher, many students, synchronous), but again, not optimal. Testing is a poor way to guarantee competence. This current emergency can be considered to be an opportunity to rethink everything we do toward finding better ways to educate people. We are forced to act and the old ways don't work in a new environment. We should be looking for new ways. 

The essentials of teaching are Delivery, Practice, Feedback, Assessment. All of these require Two Way Communication. They don't require synchronicity or exams. The first job is to teach people, not to grade them. If you get that part backwards then you are only ""teaching"" people who don't need to be taught. 

Every student is different. Nearly every student learns differently from the way their instructor does. The instructor has been proven to stand out in a particular system in which others have failed. As an instructor you have an obligation to every student willing to put in the effort, not just to the ones naturally predisposed to ""win"" in some system. Not every student starts at the same place with the same understandings. The same words don't necessarily have the same meanings to different people. 

Some people have handicaps that prevent certain kinds of interactions. Hearing impairment and vision impairment are obvious ones, but there are others. 

Learning is individual, but the process need not require isolation. It can be a communal process with learners helping each other. Denying students the option of working together is sub-optimal. A course can be a communal activity, not a hierarchical one. 

Some students will succeed no matter the system. They don't really need you for anything more than pointing to important sources/ideas. But most actually require your assistance since insight into a topic can be hard to come by. Many students actually need to be taught how to learn. If you change the system of learning they may need to be retaught how to internalize ideas and turn them into competencies. It isn't automatic or obvious. 

Learning isn't ""consuming"" material. It requires active participation. It requires a change in the brain (The Art of Changing the Brain by James E Zull)

All of these things have long been taken into account in designing educational systems, but the current practice is a compromise that values economic (scale) values over educational ones. Not everywhere, of course, but the exceptions seem few to me. 

Let's assume that everything is on the table, except that students and instructors can no longer meet face to face in groups. Meetings of any kind need to be small and optional with alternatives provided. Computer communication of some kind is needed, but costs are an issue as is the privacy of all participants. 

What to do, what to do. 

Ideas for Delivery

There are a lot of ways for students to have access to the material of a course. Books are traditional. Lecture has replaced most other methods. But lectures are longer than they need to be. Some research I read suggests that lectures of 10 to 15 minutes are more efficient than hour or longer lectures (https://spokenimpact.com/what-is-the-ideal-length-for-a-presentation/). Those contemplating video should take note of that. Video also needs to be accompanied with a transcript to aid those with impairments. 

Moreover, students need to be able to review material. Video is difficult in this regard since it is hard to quickly return to a small part that needs review without watching longer sections, which leads to boredom. Transcripts can mark the time that important ideas are introduced. 

There is a fine line between having good and poor production values in video. If they are too good, a video talk becomes just entertainment with poor learning, unless other means are used to encourage/enforce engagement. If they are too bad, then students will get lost and frustrated. Video professionals are good at this sort of thing, but it is hard to bootstrap immediately at scale.

Delivery alone is just media. Students need to incorporate what they see in a lecture, long or short, into their long term memory and into their effective competencies. More is involved than the eyes and ears. Students often think that the will automatically ""learn"" what is presented to them in a lecture, talk, demonstration, etc. but it is anything but automatic. 

Caveats: Any ""solution"" that requires real-time synchronous presence on the internet will probably fail. And it will fail invisibly for some. Connections are dropped, servers overload, etc. It is hard enough to keep students off their phone when in a class. It is probably impossible to do in a real-time internet lecture. Other distractions will intrude. Moreover, unless you have an exceptional communication system, students won't be able to interrupt you when you make a mistake, as you will. No questions are likely to be asked in real time. It is also difficult for a presenter to give a lively talk with no audience feedback at all. Especially if you are trying to do this under emergency conditions without training and experience.  

But if you absolutely must use synchronous delivery you need to do two additional things. The first is that you need to record and post your lectures so that those who must miss the original don't lose access. 

The second, just as vital, is that you provide a real time feedback to yourself (or to an assistant sitting by your side) so that questions can be asked as you lecture and so that students have a way to mention/note errors you make. 

And make sure that students know what to do in the case that you lose the server and the ability to broadcast. Avoid chaos and uncertainty as much as possible. 

Ideas for Practice

Student practice exercises and tasks may not need to change much. Students, depending on the field, need to write, solve problems, and other things as appropriate. For the most part this can probably proceed largely unchanged. Instructors have access to many such student exercises. If the students have a text book they probably have a bank of suitable exercises and questions. 

And note that practice and reinforcement is probably the most important element in a delivered education. The ""content"" that a student needs is, for the most part, available to them. There are exceptions for very advanced work, but the world's knowledge is pretty much available. Instructors help students choose the important things and avoid the garbage, of course, but it is up to the students themselves to learn by reinforcement (combined with feedback). Whatever the topic, competence comes from repetition and reinforcement. The only thing I teach nowadays is Tai Chi. We have a saying that you need to repeat a movement ten thousand times to learn it. Somewhere in those ten thousand tries, insight will start to develop. The same is true in things like mathematics and writing poetry. 

So, remember that the things that you make the students do to learn are much more important than the things you say. Good course design focuses on the student tasks, not the lectures. 

I caution, however, that copyright considerations may apply if an instructor tries to utilize exercises from copyrighted material. They are, in a sense, publishing things they send to students in an online course. Caution and legal advice is useful. 

Ideas for Feedback

Feedback is two way. You need feedback from the students on your presentations and assignments. Students need feedback on their own work. A number or letter grade on a paper isn't feedback. It gives no basis for understanding how to improve. 

If the materials presented are well vetted, such as textbooks, the need for feedback to the instructor is a bit lessened. But videos, especially those prepared in the moment are likely to contain errors. Shorter videos are easier to fix than longer ones. But, unlike face to face classes, the instructor isn't likely to be interrupted when there is a misstatement or an omission. Moreover, you need some indication that the students have actually understood what you have been saying and presenting. Again, in fact to face classes you can look at expressions on their faces for some important feedback. 

Lets assume for the moment that you have already taught your students the importance of taking notes during presentations. At the end of a lecture you can ask individual students, perhaps volunteers, to tell you an important idea from the talk. You can do this two or three times and give them feedback on their replies. This can be transferred to online learning. If readings or video presentations are short (and, I assume asynchronous) you can ask students to send you a summary of the lesson. Restrict them to one or two sentences. Another possible request is to ask them to send you a possible exam question on that material. At some point, all student replies, perhaps anonymized, can be made available to everyone. By glancing through the replies you learn whether they are getting the main points and they are also getting the reinforcement they need. 

Giving feedback to students on their work is critical to learning. This involves answering questions that they have, but also showing them where they are making mistakes, and why, in their own work. The previous section talked about repetition and reinforcement. It is possible for students to learn and reinforce the wrong message. If you get an incorrect idea deeply ingrained in your mind it can be difficult to dislodge. All student work needs to be commented on, not just graded. Publishing solutions to exercises after the fact can help, but it isn't the same thing. 

This idea of individual feedback is one of the most difficult things to arrange in the modern educational system, simply because of scale. My university teaching (and student life) mostly involved classes of fewer than 30 students. At that scale, I could easily give good individual feedback on weekly assignments. At 40 students I found I needed help. Massive courses have a problem here that requires tools - probably better tools than are now available. I'll note that Harvard's CS50 course is delivered to about 800 students at a time. But the staff for the course is about 40 individuals, so the ratio is about 20:1. Some of the staff are graders who comment on student work. Others are TAs who hold individual ""recitation"" sections of 20-30 students so that questions can be answered and misconceptions dispelled. I worry that moving such recitation online might not work as well at scale unless there are communication tools that let people learn from the questions of others. Many students are reluctant to ask questions. The brave students willing to do so actually contribute to the education of their peers. But, answering a question for a single student, say in an office, is much less productive than answering it in public, so that all can share the response. Tools are needed for this, though they can be pretty simple. University managed email lists subscribed to by students and staff are pretty effective. 

But if students produce ""papers"" of any kind, those need to be annotated and returned. More than a numeric or letter grade is needed. Something as simple as pointing a student to a place they need to review is helpful. But the goal is to foster insight. PDF files can be annotated and returned, but the process is awkward at best. And, again, there is the scale problem. It takes time to review and time to annotate. Then, the student will likely have questions that need to be addressed based on the annotations. The increase in awkwardness using current tools may require more staffing to make things work effectively. Even a simple email to a student takes more time than jotting a comment on a paper and then returning it at the next face session. 

Ideas for Assessment

In my view, evaluation and assessment are the most difficult issues we face in moving to an internet model. However, they also, again in my view, have the most potential for long term improvements in student learning, provided that we take the opportunity to learn how to do a better job of it. 

The first principle of assessment ought to be that any sort of evaluation have an actual educational purpose, not just a ""sorting"" purpose. I think that many of us aren't doing a stellar job of this, having opted for easy solutions that scale, rather than solutions that aid student learning. Multiple choice tests are overused and while it is possible to design good ones, it is devilishly difficult. Things that rely on machine grading in general are too likely to also rely on only shallow learning and memorization, rather than deep learning and mastery. If the students can be held in a room and closely monitored this sort of thing tells you something about them, but it can likely be better. Move them outside your purview and it becomes nearly impossible. And it even fails at scale. 

While you can do some technological things to lock up a student's personal computer they are intrusive but also ineffective. You can enlist a vast army of TAs to monitor student webcams (intrusive, again) but even there, what happens slightly off screen is invisible. Without such intrusive measures students have access to helpers both human and electronic. Closed-book, closed notes exams are probably a mistake in any case, but online they are difficult to impossible to monitor. There are too many inducements for students to break the rules to really assure validity. Honor codes, such as those of Dartmouth College do have a positive effect, but part of that effect is that the codes have been in place for half a century. 

I have some personal suggestions about alternatives to examinations and, especially, high stakes examinations such as finals that account for a large fraction of a students grade. I don't claim these are the only solutions, but am more interested in sparking thoughts about how we can do a better - more learning focused - job of evaluation and assessment. I implemented these more and more as my career progressed and I learned more about students and about learning. 

The first idea is to reduce the overall effect of any given exam or test. If you have forty small items you can get at least as good a picture of a student's progress as if you have only one or two large ones. Moreover, high stakes testing too often leads to poor student studying habits, such as cramming for exams and cheating. 

One technique I used toward the end was ""cumulative grading"". A course had 1000 points assigned to it and different student activities were ""worth"" a certain amount of points. A project might be 100 points. The result was evaluated (and commented on) and a certain number of points was awarded, perhaps 80. I also published the minimum number of points necessary for each letter grade, say 800 for a B. When a student accumulates enough points to ""earn"" the grade they desire they no longer need to do more. There was no risk. Another feature of it was that if the student wasn't satisfied with the points earned they could re-do the work and possibly earn additional points. Some limits were put in place, but they were generous. The philosophy behind it is ""You aren't in this course to prove to me that you don't need to be here."" But note that I could do this since the ratio of staff to students was good. This is hard to scale without help. 

The second main technique I used and can recommend is to make almost all assessment and evaluation based on student writings and projects, not examinations. And, if the nature of the course permits, use group projects primarily. For my courses the group size was usually between two and five. These groups can meet in cyberspace or, if location and other factors permit, they can meet face to face. The projects might be large or small. They can be graded once or often. Points can accumulate. It is the project that is graded, not the individuals, so everyone earns the same grade unless that is impossible. Peer evaluation is used to award bonus points or to solve issues of non-participation, etc. 

If there are a number of group projects students can move between groups if needed. But students also need to be taught how to run an effective group project. In the courses I taught, dividing up the work ""equally"" was always discouraged and if done, usually leads to poor outcomes. Students need to form teams, not just amalgamations of individuals. In CS this skill will be valued later in their careers. 

Also, peer evaluation has to be properly managed. Students don't ""grade"" one another. They comment on the contributions of a few or all of their team mates. ""Who was the most helpful team member? (or three top members) Why? What did they contribute? What was your own chief contribution?"" 

At a certain scale or with sufficient help you can easily determine who falls into which important grading groups. Who is excellent in all respects? Who shows promise? Who is getting by? Who is deficient? Who has failed? Elaborate point systems in which an 85 is somehow significantly different from an 87 have little real meaning in my opinion. 

To emphasize a point above. In many fields, even very technical ones, writing is an important skill. Writing essays on a given topic is good professional preparation for a budding mathematician. Exams can be replaced with such essays, lessening the needs for security and such. They seem to me to be much more value long term than skill at exams. But you can probably expect that students will hate it initially. 

The above, of course, are just ideas. But I found them to be more aligned with the teaching mission than the more traditional lecture and test. 

Ideas for Communication

To handle all of the above with online courses the main need is for effective communication between faculty and students and, I found, between students themselves. One goal is that what any student sees can be seen by any other student. 

Communication tools need not be complex or comprehensive. But they should permit asynchronous communication and should permit many-way communication. Threaded email lists are very useful and don't require extensive facilities. They can be private lists, managed by the university alleviating some privacy issues, open to only class members and staff. Documents can be distributed. Questions can be asked. Questions can be answered at any time of the day or night - even by other students. Someone needs to monitor these to make sure that misinformation is quickly corrected and that any rules about posting or not posting certain content are maintained. 

If project groups are long lived, then each group can have its own mailing list and can also use other tools they find for communication. 

Another useful tool is a group chatroom. Group chats can be held periodically, though the email lists were more useful for discussing course material. These are necessarily synchronous and so not every student might be able to ""attend"". But it is easy to capture the complete conversation as a text file and send it to everyone or post it on a course web site. 



My own expertise in this comes from helping to design and deliver a graduate program in which students met face to face only once a month for half a day per course. All work was done in groups (of about 5). Face time was only used for things that could not be done on line. We used simple tools for communication. All student-professor communication (other than personal things) was open to all students. Students could ask questions at any time and other students were encouraged to answer from their own expertise. The course was always live, every hour, every day. Questions got answered quickly, if not always perfectly. Students didn't get stuck. The goal was to build a learning community. That community has persisted past graduation. 



Minor updates only anticipated.

Some western papers have cited the Chinese papers, but only based on the abstract as the author would say they do not understand the Chinese full text. 

I am a graduate student in the medical field with a good grasp of Chinese and English. Can I translate without permission, or offer to translate, these papers and publish in an indexed English journal/source? If I make the offer, what is the appropriate etiquette and considerations? 
",145627,"At the scale of one person, you could do the following. If you find a paper that you think merits translation, contact the authors and offer your services directly to them. They might not be able to help much if their research is ongoing, but would, I think, respond positively. You could also suggest appropriate English language journals to them that might publish the translations. I can't predict how that would work, but archives might be appropriate. 

I think that a lot of researchers in China (as everywhere) have a working knowledge of English and so could probably vet any translations you do for accuracy. 

As for the etiquette, just ask, introducing yourself. Or even send along a sample translation of a part of a paper as a calling card. 

I don't think that copyright can be ignored unless governments intervene to change the rules. It might happen due to the seriousness of the issue.

iThenticate is a program that checks for plagiarism. This particular submission has 16% similarity, which is low. If desired the editor can read the entire report, which includes both where the similarity occurs and where it came from. 
""Duplicate submission"" checks if the manuscript was submitted multiple times. Sometimes it's in error (author submits twice thinking the first time didn't go through); other times it flags a reject-and-resubmit manuscript.
""History"" shows the history of the manuscript from submission till today, such as when it was submitted, when an editor was assigned, when each reviewer was invited, and so on. Every time the system sends an email, it's logged here.
""Edit submission"" lets the editor modify the submission (e.g. if the authors later discovered they've not included a source file, this is where to add it).
""Invite reviewers"" - self-explanatory. Clicking this goes to another menu that lets the editor both mine the current database and / or register new reviewers to invite. If this submission had a completed review there'd be a ""view reviews and comments"" button, and if it's ready for a decision, there'd be a ""submit editor's decision and comments"" button as well. 
""Set final disposition"" terminates the peer-review process. For this manuscript, since no decision has been made yet, the only option is 'withdraw'. If a decision has already been made (accept / reject), this is also where to set the final status.


The other boxes should hopefully be self-explanatory. In the review status on the right, the first manuscript currently has 3 reviewers who've agreed to do it, 1 who hasn't responded, and 3 who declined. Clicking the ""more"" button lets the editor see who those reviewers are, when the reviews are due, how long it's been since the reviewer invitation was sent out (for the reviewer who hasn't responded), and the reasons for declining, if any. 

The bottom manuscript is showing status ""required reviews completed"" because the settings for this particular journal is set to flag any submission with 1 completed review as such. Some journals might require two or more reviews before the status updates.

145494,What methods can be used in online exams to genuinely test the students' knowledge and capabilities?,"There has been a lot of talk about online teaching in relation to covid-19 and campus shutdowns.

This question isn't about that though: my question is about what ways online examinations should be treated in counterpoint to written examinations. 

I'm going to be transferring my course's written examination into an online environment. This examination involved 2 hours of students, with a pen and paper, answering questions both short and long in a typical examination environemnt.

An online exam however cannot be policed. Demanding it be anything other than open book is unrealistic. What methods can be deployed such that it is a genuine test of students' knowledge and capabilities?
",145495,"First, a two hour time limit might be difficult to enforce or to guarantee, especially if it uses a real-time clock. At some level of scale you may start to find that some students didn't get the exam paper or were unable to return it by the deadline. So, I'd start by rethinking if a time limit of less than a day is really essential to your exam. 

Second, you can pre-vet any questions you ask by doing searching yourself online for possible answers and responses. Reject questions that have too much online presence, or be prepared for getting that back as answers. Presumably the test isn't about effective online searches. 

Third, give up the idea of asking students for facts. That is obvious, I'd think, as facts are cheap. But even facts requiring computation, such as in mathematics or statistics can be generated with tools such as MatLab or Mathematica. 

The best sort of questions, I think, are those that require either or both of interpretation and insight. Questions about the why of things rather than the what and how are much better. However, these are the hardest to create, the hardest to answer, and are likely to have the widest variation in quality from students. To grade them might require quite a lot of interpretation: does this student show any insight at all into the subject? Pass-fail grading can be considered. Repeat attempts can be considered. 

As an alternative to an exam, you can consider individual portfolio development by students. Students write or otherwise create some artifacts according to some criteria. Plagiarism concerns come in to play here, of course. 

I'll note that honor codes can help to a certain extent, though provide no guarantees. And honor codes created in the moment are probably less effective than those of long standing. 
",Accepted,"I believe what you're talking about is the issue of tuition waivers: that is, are students obligated to pay fees for the tuition, or are those handled by the university.

In many countries in central Europe (including Scandinavia, Benelux, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria) PhD studies are actually paid employee positions, so what tuition charges exist are small, since students normally don't have to take many courses as part of the PhD program (international students may need to register for a few classes to satisfy qualification requirements, but it's not a coursework requirement per se). In other locales, such as as some programs in the US, grants cover tuition charges as well as stipends, preventing students from having to pay those charges. And in many of those countries, the tuition fees amount only to a few hundred euros, not tens of thousands.

It's only where students are expected to do large amounts of coursework and where no arrangements to remit or waive tuition are made that students are responsible for paying large amounts of tuition.

I'm using the rate at which papers are published on arXiv as a proxy for ""scientific productivity"", fully aware that it is not a perfect proxy and probably lags actual productivity by quite a bit. If country-specific statistics are available, e.g. ""The number of publications by authors from Italy changed by __% on 9 March 2020, the date the lockdown started"", that's even better.

  Postdoc fellowships are only the external funds I (as an early-career postdoc) can secure.


A fellowship is definitely the most significant external funding a postdoc can typically secure. If you manage to get such a fellowship, you most likely will tick a ""funding"" box on your tenure-track application in most places. However, this is not the only type of funding postdocs can go for. You can bid for funds to attend conferences, you can often bid for smaller pots of money to organise workshops, conferences, and share knowledge in science fairs, exhibitions,  outreach events. You can also engage in knowledge transfer and get funding from industries or other end-users of your research. And of course you can collaborate with established professors and get your name as a Co-Investigator or sometimes second PI on the grants they submit.


  Teaching opportunity is also limited.


This is true, in principle: postdocs' main aim is to do research and they normally are not expected to teach more than 20% of load. However, although there is a time restriction, it does not limit one's ability to engage fully with various ways teaching is or can be done. If you only do marking for 20% of your time, that does not tick the ""teaching"" box so well. But if you also conduct tutorials, occasionally deliver a lecture or two, design a (part of) the assessment, contribute a bit to designing the teaching materials, it presents you much better as a well-rounded person who can be put in front of students and trusted with a course.

Unfortunately too many governments around the world are behaving incompetently, making everything worse. But in the long run, climate change will probably have a bigger effect than the current pandemic. And it is also being ignored by some governments. 

However, unless we are willing to give up scientific study altogether and unless we are willing to give up educating the citizenry for the future, there is a lot of incentive to continue as we have as much as we can within the constraints that we see. Universities have many incentives to maintain their services and their structures. Most feel an obligation to faculty, students, society, and science itself. Those are strong positive forces. 

The incentives, however, need to be met with action. We don't have answers yet to some important questions. One of the questions is how meaningful and complete we can make an education without face to face interactions. Another is how we can continue some sorts of research, say lab sciences, without physical labs staffed by researchers. These are hard questions. It will take some innovation. Conferences could, in principle, move to virtual space, just as ""classroom"" education is doing now. 

Fortunately we are in a better place today than even 20 years ago with fairly ubiquitous internet communication. Some of the problems are probably solvable relatively quickly. 

But we don't know how many students will seek higher education in the next couple of years. We don't know how taxing authorities will deal with funding education in the face of economic disruption. Some, but not all, signs are positive. But uncertainty is high. Budgets, needs for faculty, working conditions, etc. All in flux.

147022,Should I be worried about low undergraduate grades during the COVID-19 crisis affecting grad school admission chances?,"I'm currently in my undergraduate junior year studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada. I'm hoping to apply for Top 10 US grad schools in mechanical engineering in about 18 months. In response to the worldwide COVID-19 health crisis, our institution has (as have most academic institutions) switched to online teaching and made many changes to the structure of our courses to accommodate the situation.

As part of these changes, the university has offered students the option to selectively change the grade reporting on their transcripts to CR/NCR (Credit/No Credit) at the end of this semester. Normally, my grades would be pretty good (hovering around ~3.9 GPA) and I wouldn't bother to report my grades as a CR instead of as a percentage, but this crisis has completely disoriented me and made it difficult to focus on my studies.

Furthermore, the university has allowed instructors to retroactively adjust the course breakdown/weighting away from the original syllabus--this means that tests/projects that were originally worth 15% of the grade might have been increased to upwards of 40% weighting. This has had a negative impact on my course grades as well, as I was hoping to make up for poor showings on some of these lower-weight deliverables with strong final exam performances. Instead, these final exams are going to be worth much less now.

In the aftermath of these changes, I'm contemplating using the CR/NCR option on some of my course grades, particular with any grade that ends up lower than my current GPA. However, I'm worried about how this will be interpreted in my grad school admissions in a couple years. In normal circumstances, I think changing a percentage grade into a CR/Pass grade would be a red flag that a student's performance in the class was less-than-stellar.

Given the COVID-19 crisis and its effects on academia as a whole, are admissions committees two years down the road likely to be understanding if I decide to take advantage of the CR option now? Should I make use of it and explain that this was ""the coronavirus semester"" in my application package, or am I dooming myself by converting my grades from percentage into CRs?
",147026,"The situation is chaotic and it is difficult to make a prediction or give firm advice. Either path could be better than the other, depending on the judgments of others. 

However, one prediction that I can make with confidence is that universities sending out grades will also be sending out explanations that extraordinary measures were taken in extraordinary times. Furthermore those receiving grades and such will understand that the situation was chaotic and that the ordinary procedures need to be modified. 

If it were me, I'd probably opt for the grades rather than pass/fail. If necessary, I'd just explain that the general chaos affected my performance somewhat and the grades may not accurately reflect my potential. I'd suspect that letter writers would back that up. But that is partly because I'd have a history of excellent performance generally and not one that would be questioned in the absence of the current situation. (This is the hypothetical me speaking, not the real me.)

But the pass fail option can also be explained fairly easily that the risks were higher due to general disruption and you considered it the safer option as the rules were changing, making earlier assumptions invalid. 

I expect that there will be more emphasis put on interviews and on letters of recommendation for a while until things settle down again. But that is just a guess.

",147257,"Proofreading and even light editing for proper language usage and understandability should not be an issue at all. You are not contributing to the actual work, just to its explanation. Advisors sometimes do this sort of thing.

But proofreading a math paper, say, helping the author to find the right English or German or whatever words and phrases for expressibility is ok as long as it doesn't change the content or the ideas. I'm assuming, also, that the advice you would give is non-technical. 

However, the best way to do this is to make suggestions to the author about places in the text that need improvement, rather than doing a markup. This aids the author in developing professional language skills and helps assure that you don't cross boundaries.

Not at all! It is never selfish to ask, though it might be selfish to insist, and it might likewise be selfish if you did not make it clear that you understand your advisor has the final say in this.

It is an odd feeling asking your advisor to pay for things for you, isn't it? Many students are afraid of coming across as entitled, but the better approach is to be matter-of-fact and professional about it. Simply explain (in a short message to your advisor)


The item(s) you want to get;
In a nutshell (1 sentence), why this item would help you be more productive and comfortable working at home;
The specific estimate on price or price range.


Don't phrase it as a demand; just state what you are thinking of, and then ask: ""Would it be possible to reimburse this item?""

Based on your this, I agree with the top answer that it is overwhelmingly likely your advisor will be fine with getting you these items. But articulating (1), (2), and (3) above will help make this more concrete, and phrasing it as a question makes it easy for your advisor to say no if they think that one of the items is excessive.

feedback from your advisor
how did the term go compared to the original plan (yep, here I assume that you make the plans for your term/month/week and correct them accordingly. Hopefully, some milestones are discussed with the advisor as well)
feedback from your committee (in some universities, Ph.D. students meet with their committee regularly or send them the progress report to hear their feedback)


I would certainly not recommend comparing your progress with other students because they are different, they have different goals, and you don't have complete information about their progress either. It is very easy to get discouraged for no reason.

To sum it up, I would stress the importance of initial planning and correcting the plans throughout the term. Then, you will have a very good measure of your success. You will end up with a different question of ""how to plan"", but that is a totally different problem.

147397,Letting grant funder know that funds no longer needed?,"I am a English PhD student (focusing on literature), but this year one of my assistantships through my university has involved some grant writing for local non-profits. Recently I've been working on a small grant for a local non-profit, which will help this non-profit pay for some consultants to help it develop a strategic plan and more effective organization. (The grant is offered by a foundation that focuses on capacity-building support for non-profits in the city where I live.) Because of the impacts of COVID-19 on the non-profit sector (i.e., many of our organization's donation funds are likely to dry up), our hired consultants have generously offered to do their work pro bono. 

Here's my question: what is the etiquette of letting a grant funder know their funds are no longer needed for a specific project? To clarify, I was pretty far into the grant writing process (original LOI / project proposal approved, directed to the next steps in the application process) when we learned we'd no longer need the funds for the consultation fees. (The foundation that has offered the funds is a major donor to local non-profits, so there is a good chance that we'll be applying to them again in the future--just for a different project.) Since I corresponded a lot with a representative of the foundation, I feel like I should follow up to let them know, especially as we may be applying to them again in the future ... what are others' thoughts on this issue?

(If there's a better StackExchange community for posting this question, I apologize!)
",147398,"I would ask the representative. Procedures differ wildly from funding agency to funding agency.

",Accepted,"I can provide some information about the US, and maybe a bit of perspective.

First note that the process of doctoral education is quite different in the US and parts (at least) of Europe. I'll focus mostly on things such as CS and mathematics. It may be different in other fields. 

In the US, there is a relatively low bar for acceptance into a doctoral program. An undergraduate degree is all that is normally required, though some institutions may expect more. Not only that, but a four year undergrad program in the US is a generalist degree, not a specialist one. The ""major"" subject is between 1/3 and 1/2 of the total coursework and not every student is much exposed to research. 

Moreover, most doctoral students in the US in these fields are, in a sense, self funded, as they are employed by the university mostly as TAs (sometimes RAs). Universities with doctoral programs in math and CS, also normally teach a lot of undergrad students, which means either lots of small classes or larger classes with lots of TAs. There aren't normally enough regular faculty to teach all of the courses, so they depend on doctoral students to help. 

In Europe, I suspect that the bar is higher for entry, with more courses and research experience expected. I also suspect that doctoral education there is somewhat less dependent on student teachers and assistants. In some places, doctoral students are regular employees, and may, therefore, also be teachers. 

But, I think you need to expect that no matter where you are, that doctoral education is a full time endeavor. You can ""have a life"" with outside interests, but your full time ""job"" is directed toward your degree. The exception would be for someone who can do a degree part time on their own funding. These are rare. And, I think that ""full time"" normally means more than 40 hours per week. Most people make sacrifices in that way and require that other family members are willing to accept that. It isn't so much that it is demanded of you, though it might be, but that research isn't a regularized process. There is no way to say that in X course I will achieve Y results. Insight is precious. 

Whether the ""time to degree"" differs depends on how you measure it. From the end of a secondary education to a doctorate is likely about the same anywhere. There are things that need to be learned and research that needs to be done and reported. Whether you count that as part of a specialized undergraduate degree, or an MS degree, or doctoral education, matters little. Since the starting point is about the same, and the end point is about the same, there are few shortcuts. 

So, what is best for you, depends on where you currently are. If you have the prerequisites done for specialized research, then you want a program that will let you get to it. Otherwise you want something that will help you reach that point. 

I'll note, however, that, even in the US, if you are well prepared on entry, many doctoral programs will expedite your entry into research without a lot of course preliminaries. You need to pass exams and write a dissertation. You won't, most likely, be expected to repeat courses for which you are already well prepared, though you may need a way to demonstrate your competence. You will need funding, and, as an international student, few fellowships will be open to you. So you will probably be expected to teach or TA. If you are already an experienced teacher, you may have more advanced duties than most, but (student) visa restrictions can still get in the way.

Universities, hospitals, private companies, and the military have different priorities; listing the affiliation can clarify any biases.

If it is the university or hospital, you should list them. You may need to list them both if they are both paying for you in some capacity.

You're assessing them on their ability to be good at passing your exams. They're asking for more opportunities to get good at passing your exams by working hard and practising passing them. As long as all of the students have the same opportunities, that seems perfectly ok - they might all learn things by doing that. The counter-argument that a student might get good at passing your exams but not good at the underlying techniques can surely only be an indictment of your exams as a measure of their abilities - a high mark in an exam should imply strong skills, or what's the point? If the issue at hand is that you might want to repeat questions from previous years in your exams (which it seems to be, given that you're talking about memorisation), maybe that's the real problem, and it might be worth thinking about just making new/more original questions? If you do that, then you can share more past papers and solutions with all of the students without causing yourself any real problems.

Conversely, (2), (3) and (4) are clearly more likely to be asked by weak students who want to avoid having to learn all of the material. To those students, I would simply say that since the purpose of the course is to make sure that they've learnt all of the material covered, and telling them which bits to ignore would defeat that purpose, you're not going to do that, and you recommend that they learn the whole course thoroughly to put themselves in the best possible position to get a good mark.

  Can I rightfully refuse to use the school's platform?


TL;DR: legally, probably not, but you are still more or less in the right according to the norms of academia.

Longer answer:

This isn’t so much about rights in the legal sense. The underlying context is that there is a longstanding tradition in academia that faculty own the rights to written (and other) media they create as part of their work. This is the case in the US where these rights are pretty universally respected as far as I’m aware, and in many other countries, and is true despite the fact that legally, in the US at least, employers in general can (and, outside of academia, generally do) assert ownership of all intellectual property generated by employees in a work context.

In other words, academic institutions have quite intentionally and explicitly given up some of the legal ownership rights they are in principle entitled to. As far as I understand, the guiding philosophy here is that faculty exercise a lot more freedom and control over what kind of materials they produce compared to employees in other sectors. That means the work is regarded as being of a more personal, creative nature, and it was decided long ago that that should mean that faculty would be the owners of the work. (Note: I am talking specifically about copyright; for other forms of IP like patent rights, a quite different philosophy and different policies typically apply.)

Coming back to your question: I think you are quite right to be concerned. Your university is at the very least showing itself as somewhat deaf to these very old and well-established ideas. But can you “rightfully refuse”? Legally, that’s less clear. But it would be quite reasonable to express a concern. At my university the administration has provided reassurance to faculty that their copyright over teaching materials would be respected during the COVID-19 crisis, and we were given quite specific explanations on how our rights would be balanced against the need to deliver our teaching remotely, including providing recordings, what steps we can take to prevent students from sharing our materials, and more. Perhaps by raising the issue you and your colleagues can push your own administration to also think this through a bit more.

Let me finish by encouraging you to also adopt a more flexible and tolerant mindset. All of us are called upon these days to get out of our comfort zone and appear in online videos and recordings, use online platforms with awful records on privacy, and generally engage in activities that in normal times we might consider distasteful and privacy-violating. We do this with the understanding that exceptional times call for exceptional measures, and that the highest priority right now is to keep the lights on at our institutions. As I said, I think your concern is reasonable and probably you can reach some sensible understanding with your administration about your class materials. But while you discuss the issue with them, try to keep some perspective and not make yourself too much of a pain in the butt. As important and valid as this is, people do have worse things to worry about these days.

I hold citizenship of a country included in the Exchange Visitor Skill list for J1 visa holders (my research area, biological sciences, is on the list as well). My postdoc project is funded by NIH/NSF grants to the lab (not in a university). I completed a Ph.D. in a major US university last year, and my work authorization is under the F1 OPT. In light of diminishing faculty openings, I do not have a strong preference for staying in academia long term.

Details:
I started my current (and first) postdoc position a few months back, and this position is funded for the next few years. My advisor has been great, and she is supportive. I am also satisfied with the progress being made in the project. 

Due to the increased visa denials, I was advised to wait for the next visa and not leave the US during the OPT period. The HR informed me that J1 is the only option as per the organization policy, and my advisor is powerless even if she wants to help. I did not know that non-University entities could sponsor J1 and thought H1B was the only choice (a significant reason for choosing this position; my bad.) 

If I take J1, I will be subject to the two year home residency rule (which is the worst; the economy in my home country (a banana republic) is in shambles). Being on OPT would make it extremely risky to leave the US, and the status of the OPT STEM extension is uncertain. These factors make me want to look for new opportunities with H1B sponsorship. However, the fact that my advisor has been supportive and having to leave after a few months without any publication makes me feel incredibly guilty. I would appreciate perspectives on this issue.

I do have one PhD student who is a grader.
She is supposed to spend about 6 hours a week to help with the course.

",145105,"I also teach a data and programming course, though I mainly use Python.

Is it possible for you to shift grading away from an exam and toward something else?  A project, for example?  Before going back to academia I spent years working as a policy researcher, and exam conditions simply aren't a realistic test of real-life coding abilities.  For that matter, coding with the internet turned off is also not remotely what real work looks like either.

In my class I like to give a larger project and let them have a few weeks to work on it, but I could also imagine a more simple project that they only have a few days, or even hours, to do.  Real data work often comes with time constraints, but it does not come with a lack of internet access in exam-like conditions.  Just scale the scope of the project based on how long you want them to have to work on it.

There is still a huge advantage to knowing the material, rather than having to look it up.  You can also grade on the quality of code and correctness of results, and allow for creativity with open-ended questions like ""summarize this data with two plots"".  This way each student is not only tested their knowledge of R, they're tested on their actual ability to use R in a realistic environment.

If you, unfortunately, are required to give an exam, I know there is software available for proctoring online tests.  The sort of thing that utilizes their webcams to make sure they don't leave during the test, or consult other devices, or open other web pages.  I've not used them though, so I couldn't make a recommendation.  I imagine they all require university subscriptions.
",Reasonable,"One thing not mentioned yet is that publisher policies typically have a line forbidding multiple submission. For example, Springer's publishing ethics page requires that ""The manuscript has not been submitted to more than one journal for simultaneous consideration"", whie Wiley's research integrity page says ""The Copyright Transfer Agreement, Exclusive License Agreement or the Open Access Agreement, one of which must be submitted before publication in any Wiley journal, requires signature from the corresponding author to warrant that the article [...] is not being considered for publication elsewhere in its final form.""

If you dual submit, you are violating the publisher's policies. If you are detected, there's a chance you'll be blacklisted by the publisher (not just the journal), which will close all the publisher's journals to you.

145238,"Coronavirus, school lockdown and future uncertainty","I am a master student expected to graduate in April. I want to work as an R/A for my thesis advisor after graduation and want to do a PhD afterwards. However, the entire school is closed and I cannot meet him in person. When I asked him about meeting after the corona is over, he said “don't worry about graduation, you will be able to graduate online”. It seems that he does not want to meet me, which makes me feel very depressed and anxious. My only option now is to write an email. I want to talk with him over several things:


Is my thesis good enough that justifies doing a PhD? If yes, is it possible that I publish it with him being coauthor?
Is it possible I become his R/a? Even if my thesis is good, that is not a guarantee.
What can I do to improve PhD chance?
Will he write me a letter of recommendation?


I think that asking all of these in one email is not a good idea. So I am thinking to start it with the email:


  Dear Prof.A, I am very grateful for your advices for my thesis.
  Without you I would not have been able to graduate. I learned a lot
  from you and now that the thesis is finished, I discovered my passion
  for research and realize that this is what I want to do for the rest
  of my life. I have some questions, I would be very grateful if you can
  answer them:
  
  
  do you think my thesis is good enough justify me going to phd. If it is good can we coauthor on my thesis and publish. That sounds a bit
  too arrogant from my part, so I do not know how to word it.
  Is it possible I become your r.a. Your research is very interesting and you taught me so much during our time working together . I wish to
  learn more from you.
  Do you have any advice for me to get into good Phd school?
  
  
  thank you so much again!
  regards,
  B


Can you give me some advice? I am very depressed and anxious to the point I cannot move for many days.
",145239,"
  “don't worry about graduation, you will be able to graduate online”


In this context, I would translate your advisor's thought process as:


  This student sounds like they are anxious and worried about graduation. The best way I can help them worry less is to simply tell them not to worry.


Nothing there about wanting to meet or not. Indeed, if your advisor does not want to meet in person, it's more likely to stay out of the public and help contribute to reducing disease spread.

I think it's fine to write an email with some bullet points about things you'd like to discuss further. Thank them for reassuring you about graduation, but make it clear that there are in fact things you could use advice on besides just a path to graduating.

Then you can ask whether the professor would prefer to discuss those things over email, to meet via phone or video chat (like Skype, Google Hangouts), or to meet in person.

Be as patient as you can be, because this is likely a stressful time for everyone. Your advisor may not be able to meet or respond right away - don't let that worry you.
",Reasonable,"Preliminary remark: There are differing opinions on the important of the GRE in admissions to postgraduate programs, and its weight largely depends on the preferences of the academics making admission decisions.  Some regard the GRE general test as useful information, and take it into account, and some regard it as unimportant.  Meta-analysis of the predictive validity of the GRE can be found in Kuncel et al (2001).  Nothing in this answer should be read as implying that the GRE is determinative of entry, but if you are going to submit scores on this test, or if you are required to do this, it is good if your scores compare favourably to your cohort of applicants.



Assessing your score relative to your field of study: Assessing your score on the general GRE test can be done by comparing your score to data on the scores of test-takers, broken down by their intended graduate major.  Unsurprisingly, different fields have applicants with different levels of ability in the three sections of the GRE general test.  A score that would be considered good in some fields will be considered weak in other fields, depending on the average standard of applicants to that field.  Hence, it is important to look at your scores relative to the cohort of test-takers with your intended graduate major.

The Educational Testing Service (ETS) have published test data for test-takers (seniors and non-enrolled college graduates) who undertook the general GRE test in Financial Years 2014-17.  This data shows score outcomes for each group, based on their intended graduate major.  This data can be used as a reference to check how your score compares to other students who are intending to pursue the same graduate major as you.  It can also be used by academics to help them to interpret your score.  (ETS also produce annual 'snapshots' of score outcomes that give information on the scores across demographics and majors.)

If you would like to get a good idea of whether your GRE score compares favourably with your cohort (students seeking admission to study the same postgraduate major), the simplest thing to do is to compare your result to the published data for students in that cohort.  The data gives score frequencies in bins, so it is not usually possible to obtain your exact percentile in the cohort, but it should be possible to see roughly where you fall in that cohort.  The data also give means and standard deviations for the scores, so it is possible to obtain a standardised score relative to the cohort.



Example: In this related question the test-taker was seeking entry to an applied maths graduate program, with GRE general test scores of VR 167 (98%), QR 161 (78%) and AW 5.0 (93%).  This can be compared with histograms of scores from this cohort taken from the aforementioned data (means and standard deviations are also given in the data):



If we place the scores of this student into the data for the cohort of test-takers seeking entry to an applied mathematics graduate program we see that his quantitative reasoning score is actually below average for this cohort, despite being substantially above average relative to all test-takers.  The standardised scores for this student (standard deviations above/below the mean) relative to this cohort is VR 1.875, QR -0.500, AW 1.875.

This result shows that this particular student has a lower quantitative reasoning score than the majority of the cohort, and so this is likely to be a weakness of the application (to the extent that GRE is considered).  This is unsurprising when considering the fact that applicants for mathematics programs tend to have extremely high levels of quantitative reasoning ability.

145243,"In this time of crisis, would the journals Nature and Science prioritize papers about COVID-19?","Would Nature, Science or other leading academic journals prioritize publishing work on COVID-19, the novel coronavirus that has caused more than 3k deaths so far?  If so, has this happened before in the past, during another crisis?
",145248,"Absolutely. Journals are ways of disseminating scientific information, and they do take into account what is of current interest.

More specifically, however: Both Science and Nature do not just publish scientific articles, but also commentary and news stories. For example, in Science they are in the ""News"" and ""Perspectives"" parts of the magazine, and they definitely cover current events. As, if I may add, they should.
",Reasonable,"When your question bears the underlying motive/question, if it easier to publish in nature and science in the next years by doing research on this topic, then my answer would be no. There will likely be an over-proportional amount of COVID-19 related papers be published in top-tier magazines, but at the same time an enormous amount of additional funding money will flow into biomedical research institutes and create competition to solve this problem in a kind of competition, while many biometdical researchers and drug developers have already stated that the development of a remedy against COVID-19 will take 1-2 years. As Buffy commented above and I conclude, the review likely becomes and should much more rigorous for COVID-19 related papers. Additionally the submission rate and competition to get into review will rise. 

I'm aware of several retractions in nature magazine covering biomedical breakthroughs over the past years. Many retractions related to COVID-19 would not be very advertising for a journal within a reproduction crisis within academia.

I also want to mention that really important and technical papers are not only published in top-tier journals like nature and science, often the authors also choose intentionally a journal within the community to fasten the progress and reach the biggest possible dissemination. In case of COVID-19 a journal most of the researchers within a community have access to and which offers a format allowing the authors to transport the content they think is necessary to disseminate in the fastest and most completest way with short review time (which is often much longer among nature and science) to the community is probably a much better choice to save human lives.

It's a delicate question when the research question affects million of lives within a short time period, what ethically the right publishing and reviewing  behaviour should be amoung authors and journals. There are of course preprints for nature and science, but do nature and science really have the best specialists, reviewers and review system for solving a very specific scientific problem within short time or rather journals that cover since decades virus deseases? I'm at least wondering if COVID-19 will also create new ways of publishing/commenting of researchers worldwide within short-time on a very high quality level and with open-source access. 

So I'm skeptical about @Wolfgang Bangerth's answer if Nature and Science should prioritize COVID-19 papers without changing their review system/duration and if both magazines are the best place to publish such papers concerning the importance of a fast progress in R&amp;D. This depends really a lot upon how biomedical researchers share information in the fastest way via specific journals with short but rigorous review while retaining a high reproduction rate of the results.

145284,Corona virus's effect on graduate admissions,"A great many top US physics PhD programs have canceled their open houses with no plan to reschedule.

Some are intended on running ""virtual open houses."" Other's are just sending links to information that could be found on the internet regarding their program.

Is the April 15th requirement of a decision regarding accepting grad school offers of admission still ethical?

Is it reasonable to propose that April 15th be moved a month or two later?

A STEM PhD could take anywhere from 4-7 years in the US. That is a non-trivial amount of your life.
",145286,"
You presumably did some research before deciding on where to apply to in the first place. That research is still valid. Any other contact with the institution(s) and faculty add to that basis of judgement. 
You seem to presume that there is one uniquely right answer on your choice, and that getting to that one answer requires attending an open house. Likely, almost any choice could turn out well, or turn out badly, all depending on factors totally divorced from the open house. 
Note that many people accept without having been to an open house. So, the decision can be made without going to one. 
You seem to presume that actions to reduce the spread of the virus are unethical, something that I would hotly contest. 

",Reasonable,"My feeling is that unless you did phenomenally well (well within top 5%), it would not be of much relevance to those looking at your application (the likely effect would be this), and if you did do phenomenally well, then its inclusion could have the same effect as mentioning having an IQ score of 160 or more (something you'd probably not want to do, even if you did have such a score). Employers at universities or research institutions want to see evidence of teaching competence and/or research competence, not a high score on a test designed to measure your potential to do well in classwork, since presumably none of your duties will involve taking classes for a grade.

145321,Creating a secure test environment for a programming lab practical,"I'm a senior TA helping out my instructor with restructuring the course in light of the coronavirus causing in-class cancellations at our university.  We have tools allowing our students to do their programming labs online, and therefore our class can still run, but we still have a lab practical that's a huge part of students' grades, and I personally would prefer that that not be replaced by some generic homework.  

Would any of you happen to know of ways to make secure environments where a website (in this case, the tool allowing students to do their labs) could be loaded?  The student shouldn't be able to navigate to another tab or close full screen, and the website immediately submits code to the server when the time for the virtual ""exam"" is up.  

I've tried searching for examples myself, but I'm not sure if I'm wording my problem correctly because I don't get any relevant results.  I'd really appreciate the examples you have.  Thank you in advance!
",145347,"As already outlined in some of the comments, it is impossible to achieve what you want: You cannot control a computer to this extent without a severe invasion that would go far beyond anything that I would allow you to do on my computer due to privacy and security concerns. Unless you want to video-monitor students, you can also not prevent students from using a second computer, a virtual machine, or having somebody else working on their computer for them. And even then you need at least two cameras to see everything that the student is doing or that is happening to them and you would have to frequently check that they are working themselves, did not rig the video, etc.

On a more general level, controlling cheating on any exam that is based on limiting resources is already difficult if you do it in a setting that you can control (i.e., your room, your computers, your toilets, etc.).
By taking this battle to the “enemy’s territory” and limiting your knowledge, you can only lose.

I would thus suggest the following alternative.
This is how my programming practicals were done when I was a student.
I also successfully applied this to a programming “exam” in a course I co-organised.


The students do the programming practical with no restrictions except time.
For example, they may use the entire Internet, course material, etc.
After they submit the code, there is a short oral exam on the code.
Depending on the details of your course, you can very this exam in length and relevance, with the extreme examples being:


You grade the code and the oral exam only serves to ensure that the students didn’t cheat (and may be as short as five minutes).
You only check that the code is doing what it’s supposed to do, while the oral exam determines the grade and may also contain questions about other aspects of the course and deeper understanding.
Here, the oral exams may cost more time, but you also spend less time looking at their submissions.

If applicable, also perform plagiarism checks on the code.


Some pros and cons of this approach:


You somehow have to organise remote oral exams, but these could be just via the phone, if that suffices to establish the examinee’s identity for you. Also be prepared that this mode will amplify anxiety, language, and other issues for some students (while it reduces them for others).
You may need to modify your tasks to account for full Internet access and similar, for example it should not be anything to which a bazillion of solutions exists.
Depending on your topic, this may be very difficult.
The exam is more realistic: except for taking exams, your students will have Internet access for the rest of their career and using it properly is also a relevant skill.
The oral exam allows you to gauge actual understanding, whereas the purely written exam may be solved by rote-memorising algorithms, etc.   
In case of group work, you do not need to worry much about some incompetent student benefiting from a stronger partner.
(I am aware that this point doesn’t apply to you; I mention it only for completeness.)

",Reasonable,"As a grad student with narcolepsy, I was originally super nervous to talk to my PI about it.  Once I got up the courage to do so, I was able to get a number of small accommodations that made things so much better.


Because I am waiting for medication to kick in, mornings are tough. My PI worked to avoid scheduling meetings before 10am. There are many situations where this might not be feasible, but when it is it can make a huge difference.
Sometimes during the day I get extremely sleepy. I used to spend hours trying to fight the sleep off, but now that I have permission to go nap in the breakroom, I can take 10 minutes to nap and reset my body, avoiding the hours I used to spend working inefficiently while struggling to stay awake.
Now that my PI knows, I have also been able to share with her what tends to trigger my cataplexy, which helps me avoid it.


The accommodations themselves are not that big, but they have allowed me to be a much more productive student.

145328,Can I put an invited talk on my CV if the conference was canceled?,"I was invited to give a talk at an important conference, which has now been canceled due to coronavirus. Can I still list the fact that I was invited on my CV, with a parenthetical note? It's not the same as if I turned down an invitation or failed to show up. Obviously this is not really that big of a deal and I can accept it if that's not a suitable thing to do, but I'm trying to find a silver lining.
",145332,"Yes. I had a similar experience where my agency restricted travel and did not allow me to present. In my case, I listed that the presentation was delivered by someone else who could attend.

Matching the style of your CV, I would write something like:


  Academic, F. My cool title. Awesome conference. City, State. March 2020. Invited oral presentation. Unable to deliver, meeting canceled due to COVID-19 outbreak.


Based upon personal experience, I will now be adding a similar entry to my own CV. Also, based upon some of the comments, here's why I would list an invited talk even if the talk was not delivered: The invitation is an honor in itself because it shows people recognize you, at some level, as an expert on a topic. Thus, the invitation has value besides simply delivering the actual talk. 
",Reasonable,"Rather than listing it with (already) delivered talks and adding a parenthetical note, I would suggest listing it under a separate heading, such as 'Upcoming Invited Talks', where you can give the planned details. The parenthetical note could be 'Postponed indefinitely due to COVID-19 outbreak in xx country/venue.'

Two reasons for this:
(1) It shows that you are being upfront about it and distinguishing it from talks already delivered. Some may interpret the alternative as straining too hard to show an achievement. At the same time, it underscores that you have been found worthy of nomination.

(2) It is easier to simply remove this section, should you wish to edit the CV/make a modified version for some purpose. If it is in your main list, you need to ensure that numbering and sequencing is not affected. It is quite common to have different versions of one's CV for different purposes; some are very elaborate while others focus on the major achievements only. By keeping this/similar talks separate, you can easily include/exclude them when you like.

145539,How does the COVID-19 crisis affect durations of peer review and editorial handling?,"One question we often get on this site in one form or the other is: Is my paper under review (or similar) for too long and if yes, how should I react? Now, suppose I have gone through all the steps to answer this question in a normal situation: I have procured statistics of the journal’s handling or peer-review times, added a fair margin for individual variability, etc. My question is: How should I modify these in lights of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis? I do not want to bother editors more than appropriate.

The obvious thoughts are:


Some reviewers and editors are busy with challenges arising due to the crisis, e.g., due to having to switch to online teaching, having no childcare, etc.
On the other hand, some reviewers and editors now have more time available due to conferences being cancelled, not being able to access their labs, and similar.
Some fields are obviously directly affected by the crisis, in particular medicine, virology, and epidemiology. I am not considering those.


I am only interested in answers that go beyond such obvious thoughts, for example being based on experience as an editor.
The ideal are answers based on statistics, but those likely do not exist yet (but will be welcome when they eventually will).
",145542,"I am an associate editor for two journals, and although the situation is fairly new, I expect to have no substantive change in the time for me to handle papers.

The reasons for this are:


Pretty much everything is handled purely electronically anyway, so there's no physical interaction to be disrupted.
Reviewing is typically a sparse activity by people who are mostly always overloaded anyway, and it's always fairly low triage for people.  As such, I don't anticipate the availability of reviewers to particularly change: if people have more time, they'll fill it with things more important to them; if people have less time, I'll just have to ask a few more to find a full reviewer set.
The time to review is typically dominated by the time that a manuscript ages quietly on the reviewer's desk before the review deadline arrives --- actually carrying out a review often does not take all that much time, by comparison. The number of weeks we give our reviewers isn't going to change, so that dominating time won't either.
Because of the preceding factors, there's already a lot of stochasticity in time to review. Even if it does go up a bit, I doubt it will be readily detectable against the background of stochasticity.

This is an unprecedented situation with a large amount of uncertainty: no one has experience with it. So the hope for an answer rooted in experience or statistics seems unrealistic.

I have 2 advisors. My primary advisor is not working on COVID-19 related stuff. So, although she's really busy trying to re-plan all of her classes to be remote and just reorganize everything, she is not responding directly to the outbreak. My co-advisor, however, is on the response team for the outbreak in my country. Basically, she is working with the government to create models to predict the trajectory of the disease. I had a meeting with her 1.5 weeks ago and she said basically all she has on her mind is COVID-19. That was before the world went into quarantine so I imagine things have become even busier for her. 

My primary advisor sent me an email today talking about how to move forward and in the email she mentioned that it does depend on how busy my co-advisor is (but also assured me we would figure this all out). 

Unfortunately, the project I am working on now is a modelling project and my primary advisor isn't a modeller, so it's my co-advisor that needs to move the project forward. I still have other things to do for my thesis, but I am almost done those other things and I am just in the editing stages. I have a lot more to do on my modelling project, but my co-advisor is extremely busy right now. I am finished what she asked me to do a couple of weeks ago and want to send it to her.

Sorry for the long post explaining my situation. My question is, should I send her the things the I have finished or would that be a bit tone-deaf? What should I even say in the email? I don't want to come off as not caring about the biggest health crisis in at least a decade while asking her to review something that's not even related to COVID-19. How should I even frame the email or should I hold off from sending her things for a few weeks?

Especially since you're not on a strict deadline with your thesis, there are now more important things than finishing the thesis at the scheduled time. See this as an opportunity, not an obstacle.

Check if this is okay with your primary advisor, then send a mail to your co-advisor saying that you would be glad to put your thesis on ice and help her with her COVID work if she has anything you could be of help with. If you are a capable student, she probably will.  

Then, when things have calmed down, reevaluate the situation, see what you have learned in the meantime, and continue from there.

145645,risk of shifting to online learning permanently,"My university, like many others, has recently moved to remote teaching in response to the corona virus situation. In my department, the faculty have taken the lead on finding and adopting solutions to the difficulties posed by the transition. I am a postdoc and not directly involved in a lot of the big changes. But I wonder if the faculty are sealing their fate, being so helpful when there is a counterparty, the administration, that may not have the faculty's best interests at heart (note, I have no direct knowledge either way). 

Specifically, barring any big disasters in remote teaching these next weeks/months, I would guess 1) smaller schools close to insolvency, many of which have closed these last few years, would instead have an opportunity to cut costs by dispensing with or heavily decreasing in-person instruction, without facing the PR issues or other pushback that would otherwise bring, and 2) even in schools with secure finances, or where it is unrealistic to get rid of in-person instruction, professors would lose a lot of bargaining power in any negotiations with the administration, since they will be regarded as that much less necessarily. Possibly the next few weeks/months will demonstrate that the professors are in fact less necessary, and remote learning is perhaps preferable. I am not really asking about that, my question is more selfish as someone going on the job market soon. Are these outcomes likely? This type of concern must be on the radar of professors' unions, no?

In the long term, this will make e-learning a much more mainstream offering that students and faculty will become more comfortable exploring and integrating into the curriculum. Forced immersion brings familiarity and less fear. Up to now, in North America at least, we tended to have old-school in-person institutions, a few more e-learning focused disruptor institutions, and a select few dabbling in MOOCs layered on top of their usual approach. There was a lot of mutual mistrust. That will lessen. And just like a greater degree of teleworking throughout the economy, with the Pandora's box on it opened, will persist past current social isolation, so will demand for -- and willingness of faculty to explore -- e-learning.
Next year, there will be a lot of financially and emotionally wounded students, whose life plan took a pretty big hit. Some will be keen and able to return to their university campuses and continue as before. Some won't be, and when they get their affairs in order a few years later, in a world that will have lived through months of forced virtual work and socialization, they will probably be keener to explore online offerings than they were previously. And the more they start work somewhere and become mature learners, or the more straitened their financial circumstances become, the more they will seek out good-value-for-money education with schedule and geographic flexibility, and the less they'll be keen to return and pay for the conventional on-campus student experience. Of course that won't apply to all, but I suspect to enough that it will make a difference at the macro level.

145653,"Postdoc position ""on hold"" due to covid-19","I am currently in a job in the US (on STEM OPT). I had a postdoc offer from a large US university that was supposed to start April 16. I signed an offer letter for a two year contract. We were in the process of deciding which visa to apply for (H1/J1). 

Today I got an email from the PI (HR copied) saying she would like to put the position on hold until things settle down. I asked for a clarification on what ""on hold"" meant and whether the offer letter was still valid. The HR replied this (PI copied):


  As for the offer letter you signed (due to redacted’s current
  situation) please consider it void until future notice.
  
  Professor [redacted] will contact you if you are still being considered
  for the position.


This is the last communication I had with the HR or the PI.

What does this mean? Since I have the signed offer, when things do settle down, is the university legally obligated to offer the position back to me before anyone else? Or the university is formally rescinding the offer and I should just move on? Can they do that? 

EDIT: Some answers have asked about my eligibility to work in the US. For clarification: I’m in the US now, in my current status, I can work in the US till the end of May. If the university applied for an H1B (which is typically approved for non profit), I could stay in the US as long as I didn’t leave the country (in which case I would have to get a visa stamped). Things could have gotten more complicated with J1, so we did not discuss much about that. 
",145657,"A signed offer letter is normally a valid contract.  Usually it is the only contract document.  Only someone who has read the offer letter can give you a perfect answer to this question.

They have announced their intention to break the contract.  That is illegal unless the offer letter says otherwise.  Moving on is probably your best option.  

There are two possibilities:


The university is unable to pay you, so they are forced to do something that could potentially cause them a lot of harm in the form of bad press or litigation.
They did this voluntarily or out of incompetence, in which case the university is a bad place to work and you are lucky not to be working there.


In either case, you should look for employment elsewhere.
",Reasonable,"They rescinded your job offer. Offer letters are not legally binding in the US. You don't have a job anymore and there's nothing you can do about it unless you can convince the PI to hire you.

I currently am an adjunct only teaching one upper-division class at this institution.  The catch here is that my chair has asked me and the other part-timers to throw out numbers that we feel are appropriate.  I really have no intuition about what to ask for, or to simply respond (graciously) saying that I trust my chair's judgement and allow them to come up with a number for me/us.

145962,Who might lose a job in academia due to covid19?,"With covid19 continues to spread, this might affect the universities in the next semesters as the number of students might drop and many universities are offering cheap online degrees compared with the expensive traditional degrees. Who can lose a job due to covid19 in academia? Instructors with annual contracts, postdocs, adjunct-faculty, pre-tenure faculty, tenure faculty, or even all and many could universities shut down.  


Universities Issue Hiring Freezes in Response to COVID-19 
Some offers were withdrawn and one case of layoffs- see comments

",145965,"Of all the examples you name, I think only those on annual contracts have much of any risk and I think that is small. The world isn't actually ending. Universities still have their mission(s): Teaching, Research, Service. That won't change unless the disruptions are much worse than are now foreseen or even likely. 

Course delivery is being affected, but hasn't ended. Research goes on, though interrupted/slowed in some fields for safety. Funding for research is still in place and will probably continue. It will be a boon for some (biomedical) research. 

Some marginal colleges will be in trouble. Think Walden University from the Doonesbury comic, but they were in trouble before this began. Tenure Track professors are unlikely to be affected because they represent the future of the university, not some disposable resource. Postdocs have contracts and funding in place for the most part, often by grants. 

There is even a chance that the current disruption will increase the need for faculty in the short term. 

But for long term effects we need to see how the hundreds to thousands of variables now in play work out over time. And it will take time since universities have quite a bit of built-in inertia. Whether ""cheap online degrees"" have any actual value is something yet to be determined. And they may not be as cheap as you think. Some online programs are extremely expensive to create. And the issue of the actual qualifications of those who take them is important and, perhaps, doubtful. 

But even if a university were to try to deliver such a ""cheap"" degree there is the question of still needing to do research and that requires highly qualified personnel. There isn't a ""cheap online research path"" that has and likelihood of success. 

Diploma mills have a poor history, being more associated with exploitation than with excellence. 

Relax. Stay healthy. Do a good job. Climate change is a bigger risk than what we are going through in the current months. 



Some people normally employed by colleges are at risk, of course. The people who clean the dormitories and prepare meals for resident students, for example. Lots of service jobs are at risk. Likewise, there are lots of small businesses in college towns that are at risk of failure, leaving their employees (including students) without resources. 
",Reasonable,"I don't have any statistics about how common it is, but that shouldn't really concern you. The more important question is whether it is possible. 

I assume, without statistics, that in a competitive job market that many people must, in fact, change their direction. If there are too few jobs then people must look elsewhere or find a way to be more competitive themselves. 

The issue you face is really only finding a job. To do that you have to be attractive to the ones offering the job. Math is a great background on which to build as it gives you analytic and deductive skills that can be brought to bear on many problems. But you can also appear over-qualified for some positions. 

But if you want to work in specific fields, you probably need to get some qualification in those fields, even if it is pretty informal. Employers probably don't want to support you while you learn if it takes too long and there are other, better qualified, candidates. 

Some applied math or statistics might put you in a better position. 

But you need to search out jobs, selecting those that best fit your skills, but also finding a way to promote your skills as appropriate. 

You might, in fact, look for a ""bridge"" position, say as a postdoc, that gives you time and an opportunity to get some qualifications in an applied field that appeals to you.

145963,Quarantined at home because of COVID19 - how can I do engineering research productively?,"I started grad school last September, and so far have been primarily busy with courses, but have been trying to do a little research on the side whenever I can. I recently finished all my courses though, and now I'm expected to dive into research.

My advisor hasn't assigned me a project and expects me to come up with one on my own. I don't mind this really, I like the freedom to work on whatever I want. However, this was only really feasible when I was in my lab and surrounded by senior PhD students with whom I could bounce ideas off and get a lot of guidance from. 

However, now I'm stuck at home because of the COVID19 lockdown and don't really know how to productively spend my time doing research. My advisor is busy taking care of his family at home because of the lockdown, so he isn't very responsive right now understandably. I'm all alone at home so I don't have the guidance of senior PhD students either. I've tried messaging senior PhD students but it's not fair for me to constantly be harassing them for help...

Apart from heavily guided stuff in undergrad, I have next to no real research experience... Since I assume I'll be stuck at home for the next several months, how can I be productive research wise with basically no guidance or help from anyone? I don't want to just waste the next few months...

FYI, I'm doing research in engineering but everything is done using simulations, so while I have all the tools and equipment I need to do research at home, I just don't have the experience or guidance to efficiently do so.

I've been trying to just read papers in the meantime, but I can only read so many before I get sick of it. I don't want to just be reading papers for 40 hours a week for the next 3 months...

Your colleagues may give you some more ideas on what is useful to learn.

My advisor has agreed that I can work remotely (starting later is not an option). While we can Skype and most of my work can be done online, I am concerned that having no access to the department, not being able to attend seminars/workshops, and not being able to meet/talk to other students in person will put me at a big disadvantage.

I am keen not to spend these initial few months slacking off and want to catch any problems before it is too late. However, I have always found it difficult to judge my own progress when studying alone, and with a PhD it seems that it will be especially hard as I need to learn a lot of skills in a new area. Also, because my advisor seems like a very 'nice' person who does not demand that his students work very hard, I am concerned that he will not tell me if I am underperforming.

Would it be appropriate to raise this with my advisor, asking him to tell me if I am not doing as well as his students usually do? Or are there any strategies for people working from home to judge if they are doing enough?
",147005,"Yes, you should raise this issue, both with the advisor and with the university administration.

But things are in a bit of chaos now, of course, and effective response can be slow to occur. 

Virtual seminars are possible using simple or sophisticated software. Perhaps you can set up (or the university can) a group of students and a professor or two willing to have an online session regularly. It isn't the same as face to face, but it can keep you engaged. 

But at a minimum, write a lot and note where you have problems. Ask a lot of questions, but make sure they are pretty focused. Share what you write with your advisor, by email or by posting it somewhere. 

Ask your advisor directly how you are doing and ask explicitly for next steps. You will most likely get suggestions about reading. Take a lot of notes on the readings and note things that puzzle you. Ask about them.

147121,In Preparation For The Job Market - On Day 1 of the PhD,"There's a higher likelihood everyday that I am considering pursuing a PhD in my field, and ultimately, in applying for positions as a professor down the road. What I am trying to do is think ahead as to what some extra pieces of my application could include that are not research related. I understand that every field is different, but there are most likely numerous qualities and characteristics on an academic application that are not bound by discipline. So the question I would like to figure out is what type of professional development activities I can work on over the course of my PhD that would contribute to a well-rounded academic resume. 

Obviously, publications are key components in an application and over time those will (hopefully) manifest as research continues. What I am trying to do now is target other areas that will allow me to round out an application in the future. As an example, I am currently taking a Teaching &amp; Learning Program with the Graduate Studies department at my university and the program draws on the ""Science of Teaching and Learning"". In contrast to research papers, this type of thing may be minor, but I feel that developing these sort of auxiliary components to the overall application over time are all important. 

So pursuing development to become a better educator (and this is because I actually want to, not because I feel compelled to) is one thing that I can do in the present to help prepare me for the future. I am wondering what some other things can be done over time (especially over the course of a PhD), that can contribute to a strong application aside from research activities. Below is a list of some things that I have thought of that could be developed over the course of a PhD that could A) help a future application or at least B) make my life easier down the road (haha).

Pursuing professional development activities in teaching and learning
Developing introductions for certain technologies that have some relevance in my field, but can be overlooked at the undergraduate level (Programming Language or Geographic Information Systems)

I debated asking this question, because it sort of feels like a shopping question, although after some thought it felt like more of a professional development question. 
",147124,"Actually the most important thing for you to focus on right now is getting a good research experience and a good relationship with an advisor. Get started on that. Learn to go deep into some subfield of your overall field. Gain expertise in that. 

Along the way, if you want to be an academic, a bit of teaching experience will help, but will be more valuable for some positions than others. But without the ""gain expertise"" part it won't matter much. 

And I caution against trying to choose a field strategically based on what is going on this month. You will graduate, in several years, into a completely different job situation and it is impossible to predict how it will go long in advance. As you get closer to graduation, in four years or so in the US, you can start to broaden your skill set depending on the perceived needs at that time. 

But some things are valuable in any case. Learning to do research. Learning to write. Learning to collaborate. Building a circle of potential collaborators.

But most of the details you suggest are just distractions at this time. Day 1 is the day you look seriously for the best advisor willing to work with you. 
",Reasonable,"Sounds like you are in a bad situation. 

Let me just expand on what previous posters have suggested. I strongly suggest that you find another adviser. If you have peer-reviewed publications, you should be able to find someone who will allow you to graduate even if they are not in your area. Moreover, I don't think it is a big loss, since it sounds like your current adviser may not give you a good recommendation even if you stay with her. 

You should be able to find a postdoc position based on your publications even without a letter from your current adviser. Your postdoc adviser can then write you a letter. Other suggestions for getting a letter include:


The adviser you switch to can write you a letter -- even if they are not in your area, they can comment on working with you, on your communication skills, and the quality of your publications. They can also explain the situation (i.e., why you did not work with the person in your department in your area).
You can bring in an external expert for your thesis committee. This allows an expert in your area to get to know you and your work.
You can meet people at conferences who might be likely to read your paper anyway (because they are working on related things) who might then be willing you write you a letter.

  The class in question is a not a major or graduation requirement


Assuming you want to go to graduate school in a topic closely related to your major, taking one unrelated course pass/fail will not matter under normal circumstances.  It will matter even less because everybody knows students are being encouraged to take classes pass/fail during the pandemic.
",Reasonable,"If you're planning to apply to graduate school in the next year or two and already have any ideas of prospective advisors you'd like to work with, I'd recommend reaching out to them by email to introduce yourself, tell them why you'd like to work with them, and ask whether they have any idea yet about how they will weight this when considering applicants. This has a few advantage:


Depending on the field and program you're entering, acceptance into graduate programs can be much more a matter of an individual professor deciding to take you on as their student than any formal institutional views.
As such, you should absolutely be getting in touch with potential advisors before applying anyway--many professors don't even consider students who haven't reached out in advance before submitting an application.
It's never too early to get in touch, and showing that you're considering this well in advance and are eager enough to work with someone that you're reaching out to them now will reflect well and increase the chances that they'll consider your application more favorably (assuming it's solid) once you do apply.


If you don't know who you'd like to work with but have any ideas about schools you're interested in, you can also email their graduate advisor or dean of grad studies or whatever the person in that role is called there (although again, depending on the field and your career goals, you might want to pay more attention to individual advisors than schools).

With all the above as a disclaimer that the impacts of a P/NP grade will be highly variable and depend on individual schools and advisors... I'll also just say that many, MANY schools are now switching to P/NP options, so you will be far from alone in having a P or two on your transcript from this semester. I have a feeling most professors won't have much choice but to allow for this unless they want to discount pretty much all their applicants for the next few years. Also, to be blunt, an advisor/program that penalizes you for struggling or choosing your mental health over your grades this semester is probably an advisor/program to avoid. Especially if you're saying that a B would bring your GPA down, you can do better than that.

Finally, I don't know your school's specific policy, but many are allowing you to switch from letter grades to P/NP right up until the end of the semester. So you might be able to wait and reevaluate your options after seeing how your grade is doing closer to the deadline. Good luck!

I think it'd be unusual, and I honestly feel a little weird about it. Perhaps it can be done well, but consider how it would look before doing so. If you're using the quote in support of claims in your research statement, I'd wonder a) is there no support in the literature for that claim (why?), or b) if you're not confident in your own claims. If you instead hope to use the quote in support of your abilities or talent, I think it'd be better to ask the report writer to also write one of your recommendation letters. After all, if they wrote so in the viva report, chances are that they highly enough of you and your work to write a good letter. (It'd also look a lot better on paper than ""X said I'm awesome!"")

The second aspect to consider is if the quotes can be verified. In the systems I'm somewhat familiar with, these reports are usually not publicly available - at least not easily so. This means that those reading your application would likely be unable to confirm that the quotes are valid, making the value of including them kind of dubious. What's more, the report writers might have an expectation that the report isn't made public, and might disapprove of you using their words this way. (Now, you could of course solve that by asking them, but again, if it's central to your application, a recommendation letter would make the point more convincingly.)

Finally, to address your second question: If you choose to do this, you could probably just cite it as company report or internal report, ideally adding a link if it's available online. If your university do make these reports public in a more official manner, it might also be classified as a technical report, but I sort of doubt it. Generally, however, exactly how you cite something in your application probably matters a lot less than what you cite.

147193,Will a MS with ~3.7GPA with good research experience and strong recommendations offset my horrible U-GPA to get into PhD?,"My u-GPA is about 2.8 and GRE is 330, from now on is a hypothetical scenario as I haven't done my masters yet so if you could treat it as an actual case and give me subjective answers that would be great. For the masters I have found this growing researcher who is doing amazing work and is eager for me to join his lab from the start of the program. Assuming that by the end of the MS, I get ~3.7GPA, a couple co-authored pub and 1 first authored pub in reputed journals along with going to conferences to present my work, altogether getting strong recommendations from the advisor and his colleagues. Will this in any way offset my u-GPA. Also apart from research in masters I have had about 2 years of research experience during undergrad (in and out of school) and have published a paper in a peer-reviewed journal. 

I am looking to get into the biomedical engineering PhD programs at university of chicago, northwestern university, university of pittsburgh, john hopkins university, york university, and university of pennsylvania. Do you think that I am aiming too high? If so, what else should I look to do to improve my chances? Also if I start MS this Fall should I apply for PhD at Fall 2022 or Fall 2023?

Additional Info:


I did a decent undergrad thesis (not great, 8 months), soon after I did a 2 month internship a another research lab. During my undergrad I worked w/ a prof for 1.2 years (Got two papers out - one in a conf and another in a journal). Currently I am working in a top research lab, now remotely due to covid-19 outbreak.
Some people have mentioned other questions thinking that those had the same information that I wanted. But, they did not as the questions talked about how to get into ""a/some"" PhD Program after a low U-GPA and maybe decent masters. The schools that I have mentioned above are ranked pretty high and  would appreciate if you could tailor your answers to my specific question of getting into these schools.
I picked these school not to show of the ""rank"" or ""prestige"" which seems stupid honestly. I chose the because of the strength in the field (F1) that I'm looking to do research in. In one of my previous questions I had mentioned that I got a PhD offer from university of houston which does the research in F1 but it isn't very strong in other area such as: number of grants that they pull in to do amazing research on large patient populations, intellectual cohorts, and industrial connections and startup resources. I picked these schools as I believe them to be the best in F1 and NOT for the main purpose of prestige. So if you don't have anything to suggest I IMPLORE you to not ask me to look at other schools as I did not ask for alternatives but solutions or ideas

",147199,"It is good to aim high. It is also good to have broad target. If you apply to only a few schools with very similar profiles then being rejected by one will probably have a similar outcome at the others. So, I recommend a range of schools if you really want a degree and not just bragging rights about a top 50 school. 

But, about your GPA. It isn't a plus, of course, but most (not all) people who evaluate your application will weight the more recent work as more important than the earlier work. Therefore, if your recent work is good and you have letters that attest to the quality of your work and your dedication, then the older numbers will be discounted by most. 

But, the competition is still very strong and the slots are few. If someone has to make a choice between two candidates, the choice has to be made and lower priority things may bear some weight. 

However, the only way to know whether you have a problem is to actually make application to some places and then evaluate the feedback. There are some questions, like this one, that can only be answered by actually trying. But, you will be more likely to get accepted somewhere if you don't target too narrowly. 
",Reasonable,"In most situations fitting the pattern you describe, you should not ask your colleague.  There are several possible cases:


If the candidate has requested their application be kept confidential, you absolutely must not reach out to them or to anyone else the candidate has not listed as a reference.
If the candidate is currently in a tenure-track or other permanent position, I would not ask without checking with the candidate first, because outing them could be very problematic.
If the candidate is currently in a soft-money or other contingent position, then I would similarly be very careful about asking, but the consequences are not as dire as in the previous case.
If the candidate is in a postdoc or similar position where they are expected to be looking for a permanent position, then asking is a violation of the implied confidentiality of the job application process, but it is a common violation.

147303,Finishing PhD and didn't secure a postdoc position: how to proceed?,"Disclaimer: My PhD supervisor, while not a bad person, is a bad mentor and has given me bad advice in the past. So discussing this with him isn't really productive. I have talked to other people in real life about this, and the opinion of this community would also be welcome.

I'm set to finish my PhD in theoretical physics in September 2020. I applied to several postdocs, got three interviews, and in one I was rated among the top choices but, in the end, I didn't secure any position.

I don't know how similar this is to the fields, but for context I'll explain how postdoc appointments work in (edit: high energy) theoretical physics. In my field, postdoc applications run in cycles. The majority have roughly the same application periods and deadlines (around November), most offers are made at the same time (early January following year) and they all start roughly at the same time (September). There's the occasional outlier, but that's the basic pattern. This means that it's more or less hopeless that I can continue looking for a position, ask professors, etc, for September 2020. If I wanted to stay in academia, I would need to look for a postdoc in the next cycle, starting September 2021.

I am unsure how realistic it is for me to try again or if I should simply throw the towel and quit academia.


First, there's the issue of staying one year academically idle (obviously not professionally idle, that would be insane). I could work on leftover projects from my PhD on my free time, but between finishing my PhD in September 2020 and the deadline for the next cycle on November 2020, that leaves very little time to do so. 
Second, how do I even explain the gap in my cover letter? If I flat out say I failed the previous application cycle, it's a guaranteed trip to the garbage can. Some people have recommended me just lying in vague terms, like I didn't pursue a postdoc immediately after completing my PhD due to ""health concerns that have since been resolved"". I'm unsure if this is a good idea...


If anyone has any other advice regarding my situation besides these two concerns I've raised, that would be welcome too. Basically, I would like to stay in academia as a first preference, but I have no desire to bang my head against the wall against something that, at this point, might be very close to impossible. I don't have any preference for country to work in, so feel free to give country-specific advice.
",147333,"1) First the bad news: The job situation (tenure track) in theoretical high energy physics is not good, covid will not help, having a hard time to get a first postdoc is not a good sign. Having difficulty to get a postdoc is probably not your fault. There are many possible reasons, such as field not a good match, advisor not helpful, institution not a good match. However, it is not clear that the situation will be different next year. 

2) In the past it has been quite uncommon for people to work in the private sector and then return to academia. If it is just a year then you can probably finish another paper or two from your graduate work, and describe your stint as gaining real world experience. I don't think it is true that people will just discard your application, but it does not improve it, either. 

3) The good news is that suddenly there does appear to be a new track. If you are interested in machine learning or quantum information then you can try to get a private sector job in this area, and that does leave open the possibility of returning to academia after you have gained some experience (after two years, for example, or even later than that).
",Reasonable,"You should note that the word ""editor"" is used in many ways for quite different things. Most people understand it to mean ""someone who makes changes/edits to the text"". But that isn't how it is necessarily used. While the publishing industry does, in fact, employ people who do that, working with an author to improve the text, it usually means someone with some management responsibility. 

In the case of your paper, I suspect that a ""managing editor"" (a manager) has assigned your paper to a lower level ""subject editor"" (or some similar term) whose main responsibility is to track the progress of the paper through the system. He or she will find reviewers, track their progress, and collect reviews. When all reviews are in, that ""editor"" will make a recommendation to some higher level ""editor"" about whether to accept or not. If the overall decision is to accept, then your subject editor may assign someone to work with the author on improving the text - a traditional editor. 

I used the term ""subject editor"", not because it is a term of use, but because it describes someone who actually knows a bit about the subject of the paper and which reviewers would be good for getting advice. This is most likely the ""editor"" that the system is referring to. It means, roughly, ""we are handling it and progress is being made"". 

See the Scholarly Books... section of this wikipedia article for the typical usages. ""Project editor"" = ""subject editor"".

When I asked her if the results were ""OK or not""? She replied that she cannot disclose anything, but what she can say is that 


  ""the two examiners saw things very differently.....""


Now, those 'dots' at the end and the different views from examiners made me very stressed; Especially, since there is no one at the university to answer phones, because of the COVID-19! I have faced many problems during my PhD, such as my supervisors having problems with each other, my main supervisor resigning from the university, etc! And I just want this nightmare to be finished!

Does someone here knows if my supervisor's reply means there is a major problem with the thesis or not?

Thanks in advance!

PS: The reason I am shocked, is that despite almost not receiving any major feedback from my supervisors, I managed to publish a 'best paper' in a relatively good conference, based on my thesis. So, I was confident that it will not come back with very bad reviews!
Now, I am starting to read the sentence as 'both reviewers saw things differently from me and my supervisor'! Going crazy here! :))
",147318,"""Major problem"" is premature. ""Potential major problem"" though - that's likely, depending on what the examiners are disagreeing about. It's possible your thesis is fatally flawed, but it's also possible one of the examiners is wrong.

Either way you can't do anything right now, so there's nothing to do except wait for the official email.
",Reasonable,"Every university is different. Every student is different. You have picked a set of very demanding schools each of which gets a lot of outstanding candidates each year. I wouldn't worry unnecessarily, but what anyone says here is unimportant except to encourage you to apply. 

I won't be on any of the committees reviewing your admission, but would, myself (mathematician) have no doubts about your success. 

A low GRE score can result from many factors. Some people just don't do as well on such exams as other people do. I always found them pretty easy  but it was just a thing that happened. I also think that such scores are considered only a relatively minor indication of success. 

However, when you apply you will likely be invited for an interview. That is where you really want to shine. Any negatives you think you might have you should be prepared for with an honest answer. And think a lot about what you want to do with such a degree once earned. How do you see yourself in 15 years? 

Apply, but knowing that nothing is certain, have a backup plan.

147358,"Avoiding ""Zoom bombing"" in virtual conferences and seminars","With travel restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic, many academics are organizing online seminars and conferences as a substitute for regular in-person university seminars, colloquia, and research conferences.  

In real life, seminars are usually open to anyone who wants to drop in, and every attendee can be seen and heard and may ask questions.  So an obvious approach is to organize the event using video meeting software such as Zoom, and simply post the link on a public website so that any interested person can participate.  However, this also opens the event to ""Zoom bombers"", random people who just want to disrupt the proceedings with annoying or offensive video / audio / text chat - such abuse has unfortunately become very common in public Zoom meetings.

What best practices exist to keep such an event as open as possible to legitimate participants, and let them interact with each other and the speaker in a reasonable way, while reducing the risk of disruption and abuse?

What are the pros and cons of these strategies?

Strategies could be general, or involve specific features of certain software.

Some strategies I've thought of, and their drawbacks:


Create a password for the meeting.  Then the question is, to whom should the organizer give the password?  If they only give it to people they know, it excludes people who might be interested but whom they happen not to know.  If they distribute it to large mailing lists of interested academics, it raises the chance that it will fall into the wrong hands.
Offer to share the password by email upon request.  This requires extra time from the organizer to respond to those emails, and to manually verify the credentials of each requester.
Require a nominal registration fee, as real-life conferences often do.  This requires setting up an online payment system, which can be a lot of work, and may exclude people who are only casually interested, or who don't have funding, or who work in less wealthy parts of the world.  It may also involve the organizer in a lot of bureaucracy with their university as to how the fees will be managed and spent.
Use a ""waiting room"" feature, where participants must be approved immediately before joining.  However, as far as I know, the host only sees the participant's name.  If they see an unfamiliar name, how can they tell whether it is a troll, or a legitimate researcher whom they just happen not to know?  Conversely, I don't think there is anything to stop a troll from masquerading under the name of a famous academic.


I am wondering if people have thought of better solutions, that are specifically appropriate to academia.  Such strategies might take advantage of specific features of the academic community, e.g. to authenticate genuine researchers (.edu addresses? accounts on preprint servers? ORCid IDs?).  Answers could also address the pros and cons of such strategies as they apply to academia in particular, and how well they fit with people's existing expectations for academic conferences.
",147374,"How about using something other than Zoom? Other softwares support features that can help with this. Moreover there are some serious security and privacy concerns about Zoom (see e.g. this statement by the FBI and this investigation by the NY attorney general; Bruce Schneier has written an overview of the concerns here).

In our department we use BigBlueButton (website, Wikipedia) for our classrooms and seminars. It's a completely open-source and free web conferencing system. There are a few services out there that host servers but they're completely overloaded at the moment. I'd say your best bet would be to get your IT services to host a server for your department. With BBB by default new users don't have their webcams activated, and you can prevent them from doing so. You can even prevent them from using their microphone and require them to virtually ""raise their hand"" before a moderator allows them to speak. That should cut down a lot of the abuse. You can also set up the service so that an account is required before accessing the meeting. Unless the abuser is very dedicated, they probably won't bother creating dozens of accounts to continue bothering people after being kicked out, I hope.

Also, something obvious: many abusers are specifically targeting Zoom and going into random Zoom meetings. Unless you've somehow attracted abusers who are specifically targeting you, if you use something else (especially something hosted by your own department), you probably won't have any problems.

Note: I'm only recommending BBB because that's what we use at our department, but there are other services out there. I know another department has set up something called ""Panopto"" for example, and another something called ""Classilio"" - you'll have to look that up, I don't know much about it. For informal meetings we use Jitsi but it doesn't seem adequate for hosting a seminar. But in any case, if a software doesn't meet your requirements, you should definitely look into switching to something else, especially with the privacy concerns...

Third everything needs to be under guidelines of the Distance Education Accrediting Commission, in current COVID19 teaching organizational crisis we don't follow those guidelines at all.
I wonder what are legal repercussions for doing distance learning when you are not accredited to do one. Can our students with disability complain since when they needed this option we couldn't provide to them since our excuse was that we weren't ready or accredited to do so? And last but not least, can we legally organize accredited on-campus program but perform it online or using distance learning completely?
",147468,"Edit: this answer is somewhat specific to the context of the COVID-19 health crisis and about legal justifications for various exceptional teaching strategies being adopted by many universities all over the world these days. It’s not clear if that’s what you meant to ask about exactly. If it’s not, please clarify.



The COVID-19 situation and the way universities are responding to it is an illustration of the adage that “it is easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission”. Basically the situation is so unprecedented that universities are doing whatever they can to stay operational, and leaving legal questions for later. My guess is that these will all be addressed by governments, legislatures, and regulatory bodies at a later time when the people in charge emerge out of panic mode and have time for dealing with such issues.

At the same time, the question of legality is indeed significant, and people are in fact paying attention. For example, in the US, I have heard that the visas of many foreign students explicitly forbid “online learning”. As a result, I have also heard (this is basically gossip and I can’t confirm it or cite a reference) that some institutions are referring to their current mode of operation as “remote learning” in a euphemistic attempt to pretend that that’s conceptually different from “online learning”. Silly? Perhaps, but that’s the kind of advice lawyers are giving apparently. Similar fig-leaf, CYA-style advice is being given about protecting your Zoom class meeting with a password to avoid being accused of compromising your students’ privacy. Does that mean using Zoom is technically legal in the sense of being fully FERPA-compliant? Who knows - probably not. But at least we make an effort to minimize whatever legal issues we have time to think about and energy to do something about.

But the short answer is, in the academic context as well as other contexts having to do with civil liberties, restrictions on people’s movements and many other aspects of our daily lives that are being disrupted, the law is lagging far behind. People in charge will do whatever they need to do without asking for permission, and ask for forgiveness later if they have to (they probably won’t).
",Reasonable,"Perhaps the bureaucratic jungle can be skirted: Offer an on-campus program, deliver material digitally, and make a room available for screenings of that material. Deliver office hours, tutorials, etc. digitally too, allowing students to be in the room, should they choose. You are offering an on-campus program. You're also doing an excellent job of catering for students that can't make class, e.g., they're sick, their kid is sick, their car broke down, ... As it turns out, your program is also excellent for distance learning. 

Perhaps you'd fall foul under inspection, then you're reliant on begging for forgiveness, as Dan mentioned. Get your head of department on-board, get a legal opinion.


  can we legally organize accredited on-campus program but perform it online or using distance learning completely?


That's a legal question, INAL, but perhaps an accredited on-campus program can be delivered without any students present... And, if that happens, it'd make economic sense to drop the screening room, students can use existing computer facilities (typically paid from someone else's budget).

That is however typically only the case in my area when you work with them as an assistant, are doing a thesis with them or have a very small specialist class. If you only know him from hearing a lecture of 50+ students, it might well appear that you consider your relationship more personal than it is, i.e. are slightly violating social norms. However, this should normally just be taken as an oddity. So if you err in that direction it's no big deal, but it's also no issue if you don't send a mail in basically all cases that fit the question. So you can relatively safely do what feels right to you.

As a guideline, the more you already know about him beyond his professional capacity, the more likely it will be seen as appropriate. And the more your relationship so far has been distanced and purely professional the more likely it may come of as odd. A simple check is also to consider how many other students would be at the same level of closeness. When you announce something like this, a handful of mails from people that you know is sweet. Five hundred mails from five hundred peoples whose names you don't know unless you look into your student register is more a (still well meant) nuisance than a help to most people.

Furthermore, once the exact structure of the protein molecules that form the virus has been figured out, molecular biologists can then apply computer models to the protein structures and determine with great accuracy how they fold together and interlock to create a complete virus particle. 

Those modeled structures can then be color-coded as well, again in the interest of highlighting where the different protein molecules are located and how they project out from the surface of the protein.

",Accepted,"The quick answer: it is not so much that part of your death star gets sliced away as that the death star as a whole will have an extremely hard time escaping even with maximum thrust, and the part below the horizon definitely will not escape. Either the ship tears itself apart or falls in.

Long answer: you approach the black hole along what normally would be a hyperbolic flyby trajectory. Sitting in the control room you do not experience any force, since you are in free-fall along a geodesic curve. 

But as you get closer the structure starts to creak: different parts of the death star are at different distance from the black hole and subjected to different spacetime curvature. This produces tidal forces that try to pull and squeeze the spherical death star into an ellipsoid pointed at the black hole. You are however smug, since you choose a supermassive black hole and hence the tidal forces are not that severe, even at the horizon. Had you used a non-spherical spacecraft there would also had been a torque trying to rotate you, but again, death stars for the win.

Now you get very close to the event horizon, skimming it. The view outside looks decidedly weird (since you are inside the photon sphere and having relativistic aberration). At this point trouble appears: your free-fall trajectory does not continue back out to infinity, but spirals into the black hole! Unlike in Newtonian gravity close free-fall trajectories do not return out. The reason is that you are inside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). The only trajectories in this region that do not end up in the black hole are sufficiently steeply outgoing ones.

So you turn on your super-thrusters and try to break free by increasing your velocity in the right direction. But now you have a problem: the part of the death star furthest from the black hole needs merely a lot of extra velocity to be on a trajectory that leaves the hole region. The innermost part needs to move faster than light to break free. So if you can achieve some maximum boost there are going to be parts that, had they not been connected to the superstructure but freely flying, would not escape. So your boost turns into stress across the death star. Something has to give, and no matter what boost you are giving the innermost parts through the engines and pulling metal they will not move outward since they are below the horizon.

It is at this point I strongly recommend running to the escape pods. 

Exactly what the fate of the death star will be depends on a lot of things, but the simplest case is that the overall boost is insufficient and it all falls in. It might also break apart. Relativity shows that there are no perfectly rigid materials (they would need to have a speed of sound faster than light), so not even an imaginary death star will avoid getting pulled apart. 

In the end, I leave you to explain your little joyride to the Emperor. 

[It is worth noting that nothing looks strange locally when you cross an event horizon. It is a global property of spacetime, not something you can directly see. Extended objects crossing it merely have some parts whose future trajectories will meet the singularity, and the parts just outside may meet the singularity, but can escape if they break away somehow.]

So let's say you have a simple scenario of a pot of water sitting in room temperature. A simple energy balance on your water gives:

Where $q_{in}$ is the input power, $h$ is an effective heat transfer coefficient telling how much heat the water loses to the ambient (typical value of 5-10 $W/m^2K$ for a 56 C object sitting in a room with no wind), $A_s$ is the surface area of your water container, $T$ is the temperature of the water (56 C), and $T_0$ is room temperature (25 C).

So, all you need is the surface area of your water container. Then solve for the required power $q_in$, and multiply by time (30 min) to get the required energy.

$$ Q_{in} = tq_{in} $$ 

Where $t$ is the time you desire (30 min). That's how you do it.

542475,"In the Feynman Path Integral, why must ""contributing paths"" be continuous? Or is this a false notion?","I have been studying the Feynman path integral and its various derivations, and I've run into a bit of a problem. The standard Feynman path integral appears as follows:
$$
\int \mathcal{D}[x(t)]\exp\left(\frac i \hbar \int_0^t d\tau\ \left( \frac m2 \dot{x}(\tau) - V(x(\tau) \right) \right)
$$
Where the path integral is defined by passing the following into the continuum limit:
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty}\idotsint d^{n-1}x\ \mathcal{N} \exp\left( \frac i \hbar \sum_{j=1}^n \left( \frac m2 \left( \frac{x_{j+1} - x_j}{\Delta t} \right)^2 - V(x_j) \right) \Delta t \right)
$$ 
where $\Delta t = t/n$. In this form, we independently integrate each $x_j$ from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, and hence there is no innate notion that the paths considered must be continuous; $x_{j+1}$ and $x_j$ can be as far apart as we please. 

In doing readings, I have found multiple sources that claim that the paths we consider are continuous, for example in this paper. In transforming to imaginary time ($-t \to -i\tau$), this claim makes sense, since discontinuities in the path will blow up the the sum and they will be exponentially suppressed. However, in the form presented above, I am not quite sure where and how we can make this claim.

I have seen the argument that paths that deviate greatly from the classical path will lead to extreme oscillatory behavior from our phase, and hence will be suppressed since they will on-average integrate to zero. However, I don't think I am satisfied with this argument to claim we must have continuity. This shows which paths contribute the most, but I don't think it rules out discontinuous paths. Does anyone have insight into this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
",542484,"The paths of a Feynman integral do not always have to be continuous, and the first example that comes to my mind is the Feynman integral in the Feynman-Vernon formalism, which is used to study the spin-boson model, among other things.

For the spin-boson problem, the $x(t)$ paths written in your question, are discontinuous. If the spin in your spin-boson problem is a spin-1/2 particle, then $x(t)$ will be either -1/2 or +1/2 at each time $t$, and the Feynman integral will be over all possible paths, of which I'll give four examples below: 


$x(t)$ = -1/2 for all $t$.
$x(t)$ = +1/2 for all $t$.
$x(t)$ = -1/2 from $t=0$ to $t$=5ps, and $x(t)$=+1/2 for the rest of the time.
$x(t)$ = -1/2 from $t=0$ to $t$=5ps, $x(t)$=+1/2 from $t$=5ps to $t$=10ps, then $x(t)$=-1/2 for the rest of the time.


If you allow all possible flips between spin-up and spin-down between $t=0$ and the rest of your desired time for the Feynman integral, there will be an infinite number of such paths. 

The software FeynDyn (Feynman Dynamics) can calculation such Feynman integrals for up to 16 spin-1/2 particles (or 16 qubits, if simulating a quantum computer in the presence of noise) and more information about this whole ""Feynman-Vernon"" formalism can be found in this paper (I have given a free link to the PDF rather than the original journal, in case COVID lockdown has caused you not to be on a campus where you can download papers easily). 
",Accepted,"My understanding is that most paths are inherently discontinuous, and the transition to functional integration is a symbolic one.

However, many applications of path integrals are centered on the stationary phase approximation, which in case of path integrals cited in the question corresponds to a quasi-classical trajectory and small fluctuations around it. In this limit the contribution of discontinuous paths is indeed negligeable.

A ""corona virus"" has a layer of spiky proteins around its surface, so it looks like a crown under an electron microscope.

An electrical coronal discharge happens when the electric field near an object is high enough to ionize the air; it makes a spiky glow that looks kind of like a crown. The ionized air molecules can participate in chemical reactions that aren't available to neutral air molecules, and that chemistry is a factor in the aging of high-voltage electrical systems.

In your abstract they write that most modeling of coronal discharges are of direct-current discharges, while they focus on alternating- current (AC) discharges.  For an example of the difference between anode and cathode chemistry, see this post.

538796,Has anyone tried to find the wavelength to the Corona virus cell?,"I have seen websites and videos that show how cancer cells can be destroyed using sound resonance oscillation. So has anyone heard of anyone who is in the field of sound resonance trying to capture the wavelength of the Corona virus so we can create a Sonogram machine to use against this virus pandemic?
",538809,"It's a nice idea. Sadly it won't work but there is still some interesting physics involved.

As a general rule resonance is only an efficient way to transfer energy to an object if that object has a high Q factor. A high Q factor means the energy supplied builds up and increases the amplitude of the oscillation, and this may get large enough to damage the object. This is the (alleged) mechanism for the shattering of wine glasses by overenthusiastic sopranos. Wine glasses have a high Q and you can tell this by the way they ring for a while when you tap them. As a contrast, potatoes have a low Q and do not ring when you tap them. So our sopranos would have a hard time shattering a potato.

The problem with using ultrasound to kill cells or viruses is that in general they are squishy low Q objects like potatoes, not high Q objects like wine glasses, and they do not store the energy of the sound efficiently enough for the amplitude of oscillation to build up to destructive levels. So the technique simply won't work.

Ultrasound is used to kill tumours, but this does not work by resonance - the energy in the sound simply heats the cancer tissue and kills it. It is used for tumours because the sound can be focused onto the tumour where it causes local heating. This would not work for viral infections since the virus is distributed throughout the body not concentrated in one area onto which the sound can be targeted.

Even if viruses were brittle like glass it would still be hard to make them resonate enough to be damaged when they are in a fluid like water. There are two reasons for this.

Firstly water is much denser and much more viscous than air so it efficiently damps the vibrations of any objects moving in it. For example if you tap a glass underwater it will not ring as it does in air. So even objects that have a high Q factor in air will have a drastically lower Q factor in water. This applies to viruses in humans since as far as sound waves are concerned human tissue is little different from water.

Secondly sound waves are a compression wave and they propagate by alternately compressing and expanding the water. The amount the water compresses and stretches is determined by the bulk modulus and this is relatively high. That means the amplitude of the wave is small unless the energy is very high, and consequently the mechanical deformation of objects in the water by the wave is small. This makes it hard to deform the virus enough to damage it.
",Reasonable,"There is a difference between cancer and a virus infection. 

A virus invades a cell and uses it to produce more virus. These go on to invade more cells. Many viruses reproduce so much that the cell bursts. To many dead cells kills the patient, or at least makes him sick. 

Cancer is a problem where the patient's cells malfunction. They reproduce uncontrollably. The mass of growing cells is called a tumor. A tumor can kill the patient. One ""cure"" for cancer is to kill just the out of control cells. 

If you applied this approach to a virus, you would have to kill more or less all the cells in the patient.

541655,Is it possible that an instant coffee 3 in 1 (or any other type of coffee) is cooling faster than tea?,"I have observed a strange phenomenon. I my mouth is very sensitive to very hot liquids (like, freshly made tea, or just freshly boiled water), so when I make my tea, I usually wait around 20 minutes before drinking it.

I am also a fan of a particular 3 in 1 instant coffee (3 in 1 meaning instant coffe + instant milk + sugar). I am taking one pack of mentioned coffee (21 grams in one package), pouring it with with freshly boiled water, mixing the coffee with water using a teaspoon in room-temperatured cup, then I am going to the toilet for ~5-7 minutes. When I come back from the toilet, my coffee is ready to drink. It is hottish, but I can drink it right away.

Later on (2-3 hours later), I am making a cup of tea, using the same cup, which is in the room temperature again. I am pouring two teabags (4 grams of tea) with the same amount of freshly boiled water, and I make my breakfast. It usually takes me around 10 minutes to make my breakfast, and when I am trying to drink my tea right after finishing making by breakfast, it is still hot as hell. I am usually waiting another 10 minutes, then the tea is still hotter than the coffee after 7 minutes, but it starts being acceptable for my sensitive mouth.

I have even bought a food thermometer to check the cooling speed of both liquids, but because of the coronavirus outbreak it hasn't arrived yet, but my ""internal"" thermometer - my lips, and isides of my mouth cannot be wrong. I can drink the coffee after ~7 minutes, and the tea after ~20.

I would understand a little change in cooling time, cause we are talking about 21 grams of instant coffee-sugar-powdered mix, the liquid is a bit densier, maybe there is more energy used to dissolve the coffee ingredients, the instant milk contains fat, but still - i am talking here about 13 minutes of difference between the time when my mouth can accept the temperature of both liquids, and we have to remember that the tea is still a hotter 20 minutes after I pour it with boiling water than the coffee 7 minutes, but it is drinkable.

Is there an explaination for this?
",541845,"I can think of two possible differences which might contribute this result, but I am not sure how you could test them. The different composition of the drinks will affect the surface tension. This could affect the rate of evaporation of the liquid. If this is the case, it may make a substantial difference to the rate of cooling as evaporation is probably the greatest cause of loss of temperature.

The other cooling effect which will be different is radiation. Do you add milk to your tea? If the coffee is darker than the tea, it will radiate faster and cool faster for that reason. 

If you don't add milk, the tea will be translucent. I am not exactly sure how that will affect things, because it means that radiation is possible from the interior, not just the surface. Also it may not be translucent for the wavelengths radiated. But generally, I think a translucent substance will radiate much less. 
",Reasonable,"Yes, I think $1\,\mathrm{lx}$ is indeed absurdly low for a flashgun of any reasonable capacity.

A very brief intuitive argument as to why this is is that the flashes from flashguns last for under $1/1000\,\mathrm{s}$ and yet, distances of the order of $1\,\mathrm{m}$, they can light scenes brightly enough in that time to be equivalent to an exposure of $1/100\,\mathrm{s}$ of the same scene in full sunlight.



Below I have tried to put a numerical value on how bright a flash must be for a particular (non-exceptional) model.  I suspect that this contains errors, but it bears out the intuitive argument above.

Although I don't know how bright cellphone flashes are, it's possible to work out how bright camera flashes are since they publish enough information.  As an example, I took the Pentax F-360 FGZ II flashgun (manual: this was just the first I found in a page of flashes and it looks like a non-stupidly-powerful one: I presume it is brighter than cellphone flashes).  This has a 'guide number' of $36$ (in metres, at ISO $100$: see below), and at full brightness it lights for $1/1200\,\mathrm{s}$.

The first thing to sort out is how large an area the flash illuminates at a given distance, $d$.  I will assume that it covers enough area for a $50\,\mathrm{mm}$ lens on $35\,\mathrm{mm}$ film with a fudge factor of $2$ (so, twice the area).  Such a lens has an angle of view, $\alpha \approx \pi/8$ (45 degrees in old money).  So assuming a standard $3/2$ film frame, I get that the area covered, $A$ is

$$
A = 2 \times \frac{24}{13}\left(d\tan\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\right)^2
$$

Where the  $24/13$ comes from fitting a film frame into the image circle of the lens, and the $2$ is the fudge factor (the flash covers some rectangle which is going to be significantly bigger than the film frame or there will be vignetting), which is probably really quite a lot larger than $2$.  And I may have made mistakes in this but it's good enough.

So now, rather than think about lumens or lux which will require knowing the albedo of whatever the camera is looking at, I will work out how bright the flash must be compared to full sunlight.  This is helped by knowing the famous sunny 16 rule, known to all photographers of a certain age:


  in full sunlight, you get reasonable exposures with a film of ISO speed $S$ by exposing for $1/S\,\mathrm{s}$ at $f/16$.


And now we come to the nightmare of flash guide numbers, which are not numbers but quantities with dimensions.  The basic definition of a guide number, for a given film (or sensor) speed $S$ is that

$$
G_S = \frac{d}{a}
$$

where $a$ is the aperture of the lens.  $a$ is dimensionless (it's the ratio between the focal length and the effective diameter of the lens), so the units of $G_S$ are length.  This definition works because the light that gets into the lens goes as the square of the aperture $a$, and the amount of illumination falls of as the square of distance $d$.  And really I should factor in $S$ here but I've just defined $G$ at a given speed, $S$.

So for the flash referenced at the top of this answer, we know that $G_{100} = 36\,\mathrm{m}$, and since we're interested in $f/16$ because we know the sunny 16 rule, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
d &amp;= \frac{G_{100}}{16}\,\mathrm{m}\\
  &amp;= \frac{36}{16}\,\mathrm{m}\\
  &amp;= \frac{9}{4}\,\mathrm{m}
\end{aligned}
$$

In other words, as $f/16$ &amp; using ISO $100$ film, this flash will light something a bit over $2\,\mathrm{m}$ away.

But it does this in $1/1200\,\mathrm{s}$, and in fact I will add another fudge factor of $2$ here, because the flash isn't a perfect top-hat function, it will ramp up and down.  So I'll assume that it does it in $1/2400\,\mathrm{s}$.  In other words, at this distance, it lighting the scene $24$ times more brightly than the Sun, because the Sun takes $1/100\,\mathrm{s}$ to do the same thing.

And finally we can work out the area it must illuminate from above: we now know that $d = 9/4\,\mathrm{m}$ and $\alpha = \pi/8$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A &amp;= 2 \times \frac{24}{13}\left(\frac{9}{4}\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{16}\right)\right)^2\\
  &amp;\approx 0.74\,\mathrm{m^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

So based on the lux table here, full sunlight might be $50\times 10^3\,\mathrm{lx}$, so this flashgun must be putting about $1200\times 10^2\,\mathrm{lx}$ into an area of about $0.74\,\mathrm{m^2}$.

I'm kind of uncomfortable with this working, because I'm unwilling to believe flashguns are that bright (note there are two fudge factors here which could reduce things by a factor of $4$ though).  But I think it is very clear that, yes, $1\,\mathrm{lx}$ is absurdly low as the brightness of a flashgun.

How is this possible that it's difficult to find mask for the Corona Virus? I have been several times to 7/11, boots, Watson, and other pharmacies, and everytime they did not have it as they ran out. How is it possible that the producers of masks give up on additional earning by not producing more masks, now that it's pretty obvious the demand is going up?

The fact that there are not enough masks is my personal experience in Bangkok - however, some friends of mine have the same experience in Italy, where the Corona Virus outbreak has reached a scary stage.

Generally. I would explain capitalism failure by pointing at government regulations - however in this case I don't see how the government can be involved into mask production. 
Any idea? 
",34149,"This is a common problem in many domains. For example, there's massive new demand of Airbus planes after the Boeing 737 Max 8 disaster, and their manufacturing capacity is maxed out.

I'm familiar with it from the domain of software development, so I'll use that as an example.

Suppose some website gets mentioned on Reddit and the post happens to hit the first page. It gets the ""Reddit hug of death"" (the swarm of reddit users overwhelm the website's servers, and it becomes unavailable). You could ask the same question:


  How is it possible that the producers of [this site] give up on additional earning by not [spinning up more servers], now that it's pretty obvious the demand is going up?


If that ""additional earning"" (of having more of your product available to provide) is less than it costs to permanently over-provision a resource (web servers, mask production factories, etc.), then it's not economical to do so.

Cloud infrastructure is becoming incredibly liquid, because resources are very flexible and can be pooled. A high traffic day for my website might be a low traffic day for yours. A cloud provider could scale down your site (saving you money) by uninstalling your software from a server, reassigning that server to me, and use it to scale up my site by installing my software on it (raising my infrastructure costs, but also raising my business' income because it hasn't gone down). There are even auto-scaling systems that can scale your service up and down in response to current load. There's still some lead time, on the order of a few minutes for web server virtual machines.

The real world is much less flexible than software. If masks are in hot demand, but construction helmets aren't, you can't re-purpose the injection molds for hard hats into face-mask stitching machines. There are many factors involved in deciding whether or not its worth in investing to grow the mask manufacturing business:


How many masks are available in reserve? In the warehouses of factories and distributors, in hospitals, in military bases, etc.
How long do we think this epidemic will last? Will it last long enough to deplete the reserves? Is it long-term enough to justify the high up front expenses?
How much marginal profit is there to be made in selling these extra masks?


Interestingly, this problem repeats itself and plays itself out upstream in the supply chain. Are the companies that make mask-stitching machines able to produce enough for the new demand? What about their upstream supply chain?

Won't Cal demand  his principal back at some time in the future? 
Similarly, won't countries' sovereign debts demand their principal? 
For example, China holds much US treasuries and US sovereign debt. If China thinks COVID-2019 will cripple the US and wants to park its money else where, won't China demand all of its principal from the US so that it can buy Australia or New Zealand sovereign debt instead? 



  'Country A owes \$10  to country B, and has agreed to pay 2% interest annually. Call this Debt X.
  
  Country B owes \$15  to country A, and has agreed to pay 1% interest annually. This is Debt Y.
  
  Investor A is willing to purchase Debt X for \$12, because he values the steady rate of return, and believes country A is very likely to pay its debts. He isn't as sure about Debt Y, but he is willing to pay \$16 for it. Investor B thinks that investor A is going to change his mind about Debt Y and value it more highly, so he is willing to pay \$17 for it today.
  
  Debt is traded constantly and it's valued differently. Just because 2 countries owe each other similar amounts of money, doesn't mean the value cancels out in any meaningful way.
  
  Think of debt this way. You and your three brothers all own a house together. Each year you take up a collection of \$1000 a head for \$~4k annual upkeep on the house. One year, a tree falls on the roof, and the house needs another \$4000 bucks. Everyone could just chip in 1k each, but one brother is having a tough year, so instead, you loan the house \$4k, with the expectation that it will pay you 1% interest a year.
  
  Your brothers agree, and over the years, this comes up a few more times. You even use debt to finance installing a new hottub. You now own \$20k in debt from the house, 1 brother owns \$5k, and for some weird reason, your neighbor Cal wants to purchase the debt from you. (He really thinks your household is trustworthy, and wants somewhere to park \$20k for 1% interest).
  
  Now C owns \$20k of debt from your house, so C owns 80% of all your house's debt. Would you say C owns your house now? Well of course not, your house is likely worth many times more what C has claim to. If someone in your house is super worried about the situation, they could take up a collection in the house to buy the debt back from C, but it's not a popular idea, because most people can think of better things to do with their money than pay off C so they don't have to make the small yearly interest payments.

",34495,"
The principal has to be repaid eventually but with majority of formal debt instruments such as government bonds the creditor can’t just demand repayment whenever he or she wants. Most debt instruments have pre-specified date and if not date then conditions when and how the principal is being paid back.


For example a standard 10year bond will pay its principal in 10 years not a day earlier (unless you actually manage to convince the debtor to voluntary agree to pay it sooner).


The above works for sovereign countries too. A 10 year government bond will have on it printed that principal is payed back exactly after 10years. 


Now this is outside economics, but technically sovereign nations are in state of anarchy so I can imagine one country could just decide to say to another pay now or we will invade you/nuke you etc. but aside of some military intervention there is no way of legally forcing the country to pay.

In fact any government can, in principle, default on its debts anytime it wants. The only constraint on sovereign default is that if you constantly default on your debt nobody will want to lend you money in the future, or if only at punitively high interest. Hence on sovereign level governments as debtors have much better bargaining power than just individuals.

Government can be forced to pay its debt only through military action, or in some cases by diplomatic pressure (for example EU could threaten Greece by revoking its euro-zone or EU membership, US could threaten countries by economic sanctions etc.). Aside from that there is nothing other country can do to get its money back if debtor nation says no.


Based on 1, and 2 you probably already know the answer. No that’s not possible. China could patiently wait for bonds to expire and then not buy new US bonds but instead buy Australian or New Zeeland bonds. Of course, since there is a lot of debt being issued by US government probably every month there are bonds expiring and being replaced by new ones so China could start do it sooner than later.


Also beside of that, usually when people want to get rid of a debt they won’t wait for maturity and for repayment of the principal. They will take the bond to bond market and sell it at market price to get money now. That creates a trouble for country in a sense that now it has to set lower price or higher interest on its newly issued bonds due to increased supply, but whether this becomes a problem depends on plethora of factors many unrelated to the original debtor and creditor countries, such as how big is the demand for the debtors bonds etc.

The forecast results indicate that: (a) Affected by the epidemic, China’s economy will lose 4.8 trillion yuan in the first quarter of 2020, which is an expected decrease of 20.69% and a year-on-year drop of 15.60%; (b) China's expected GDP growth rate for the full year of 2020 will reduce from 6.50% to 1.72%.

Of the lives saved, 630,000 are due to avoided overwhelming of hospital intensive care units. Using the projected age-specific reductions in death and age-varying estimates of the United States Government’s value of a statistical life, we find that the mortality benefits of social distancing are about \$8 trillion or $60,000 per US household. Roughly 90% of the monetized benefits are projected to accrue to people age 50 or older. Overall, the analysis suggests that social distancing initiatives and policies in response to the COVID-19 epidemic have substantial economic benefits.

  The U.S. economy is projected to contract by 14% in the second quarter, after experiencing a 4% contraction in the first quarter, before recovering to 8% and 4% growth in the third and fourth quarters. Euro area GDP will suffer an even deeper contraction, with double-digit declines of 15% and 22% in the first and second quarters, before rebounding by 45% and 3.5% in the third and fourth quarters.
  
  “There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter. We now think that the COVID-19 shock will produce a global recession, as nearly all of the world contracts over the three months between February and April,” said Bruce Kasman, Chief Economist at J.P. Morgan. Initially, the expectation was the novel-recession may generate limited labor market damage, but J.P. Morgan Research is now forecasting the unemployment rate for developed markets as a whole will rise 1.6 percentage points in the next two quarters.
  
  “The rise in unemployment will be sharper in the U.S. than in the Euro area. Most immediately, U.S. initial jobless claims should spike above 400,000 in the coming weeks,” said Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan.


McKinsey has a somewhat spread-out (March 25) presentation, but a couple of slides with their scenarios/estimates I could fish from there:




Likewise, PWC has a March [white]paper mostly focused on Australia... but which does come with a global map attached of their estimates of GDP losses, alas in absolute figures only (and I think over one year based on what they say on the previous slide):





Before the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a niche academic domain of estimating the economic impact of pandemics already, typically using a CGE model. Results depend of course on the assumptions used. E.g. Smith, Keogh-Brown et al. had a series of papers approximately a decade ago. Quoting from a later one that covered more than one European country:


  Results suggest GDP losses from the disease of approximately 0.5–2% but school closure and prophylactic absenteeism more than triples these effects.


So they went as high ~10% GDP losses. While they did not envisage government mandated lockdown(s), they modelled ""prophylactic absenteeism"" in response to ~3% death rate media reports as the most severe case. An earlier paper of theirs, on UK only is open-access in the BMJ. Quoting their assumption from there


  almost everybody in the population will know someone who has died once the mortality rate reaches one death per 300 people, triggering prophylactic absenteeism.


The same authors (Keogh-Brown and Smith) also published in 2008 a fairly detailed post-hoc account of how economic predictions for SARS fared in hindsight... which generally wasn't all that good, meaning that most models overestimated the economic impact of SARS. It cites positively an 2003 ADB paper of Fan that hedged its bets on two different scenarios (early containment being one of them).

Another paper Verikios et al. (2015) in a similar vein but attempts a global estimate (GTAP CGE), and also discussed prior/related work:


  The two pandemic scenarios modelled give quantitatively and qualitatively different
  results. [...] Our results show that the peak GDP effects on the world economy of an influenza pandemic are in the range 0.06 to 1.01 per cent in the peak year depending on the nature of the pandemic. Our results are smaller than the only previous estimates of the global economic effects of influenza pandemics by McKibbin and Sidorenko (2006). They estimate reductions in global GDP of between 0.8 and 12.6 per cent depending on the severity of the pandemic. Our results are not directly comparable to McKibbin and Sidorenko as they did not model a continuum of pandemic scenarios across the virulence-infectiousness continuum. Rather, they assume a given reproducibility of the virus (infectiousness) and vary virulence across their four scenarios. Further, they implicitly assume multiple waves for all their scenarios as they presume that
  new infections continue to occur for greater than one year. This is likely to characterise only more extreme pandemics (such as the 1918–19 flu) rather than milder pandemics. Differences in the range of influenza pandemics modelled by us and McKibbin and Sidorenko are justifiable given the uncertain nature of future pandemics. Our results thus build upon the findings of McKibbin and Sidorenko by extending the estimation of potential GDP estimates over a further range of potential pandemic threat scenarios.
  
  [...] Our results show that the global macroeconomic effects of an influenza pandemic may be significant but are also likely to be short-lived. The largest economic impacts of an influenza pandemic are driven by reduced international tourism, due to risk-modifying measures by households and travel restrictions imposed by health authorities, and lost workdays, due to illness or formal social distancing measures designed to contain the virus. This is consistent with the work of Keogh-Brown et al. (2009, 2010). [...] 


Verikios seems to work for KPMG Australia nowadays and they have released a COVID-19 model that is fairly detailed in explaining its assumptions, for example it has separate pre- and post-stimulus arms/scenarios, but it mostly covers the Australian case, in particular only models the government response of that country.

KPMG uses a NiGEM (New-Keynesian) macro model, and they've basically tweaked some parameters of this using estimates of shocks in four areas: reduction in productivity due to additional sick leave by workers, reduction in productivity due to additional carer’s leave by workers, incremental investment premium, capacity utilisation adjustment (i.e. supply chain disruptions). The first two were informed by fairly detailed labour &amp; health statistics, the latter two seem a bit more arbitrary to me, e.g. they added a flat 1% investment premium.



I was hoping the IMF would have something more concrete than this, but I guess
they are weary of advancing anything more detailed yet:


  The COVID-19 pandemic would cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, but world economic output should recover in 2021, the IMF said on Monday.
  
  Georgieva issued the new outlook after a conference call of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, who she said agreed on the need for solidarity across the globe. [...]
  
  The outlook for global growth is negative and the IMF expects “a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis, or worse,” Georgieva said.
  
  Earlier this month, Georgieva had warned that 2020 world growth would be below last year’s 2.9 percent rate, but stopped short of predicting a recession.
  
  Georgieva on Monday said that a recovery is expected in 2021, but to reach it, countries would need to prioritize containment and strengthen health systems.
  
  “The economic impact is and will be severe, but the faster the virus stops, the quicker and stronger the recovery will be,” she said.


The CBO has now posted its own assessment for the US economy. It disclaims that it is ""highly uncertain, especially for later periods"", but basically, for the second quarter of 2020 it predicts 10 percent unemployment and the economy to contract by ""more than"" 7 percent.

34624,Won’t paying wages to temporarily unemployed due to Coronavirus result in inflation?,"UK government promises to pay 80% of wages for people unemployed due to coronavirus. I am not economist, so I am probably missing something, but shouldn’t paying wages to unemployed due to coronavirus result in inflation due to decreased products and services created by economy? Is that just a mechanism to redistribute wealth?
",34627,"Not by itself. The inflation generally depends on the following monetary relation:

$$ MV =PY$$

Where M is money supply, V velocity of money (how much one buck is used in economy), P is the price level (change in which is inflation), and Y is a real output.

Now solving for P so we can focus on inflation gives us:

$$P=\frac{MV}{Y}$$

Hence price level (and consequently) increases when money supply increases, velocity of money increases or output decreases.

Now let’s analyze giving money to those unemployed.


Is it newly created money? If not then money supply won’t increase. If yes then it would increase inflation rate.
Redistribution generally does not affect velocity of money much so we can skip that.
Does this change the output Y? Well not by much those people are already unemployed. If anything it could increase Y as unemployed have probably high marginal propensity to consume so in short run redistribution from a richer person with lower marginal propensity to consume will increase Y. Especially if this spending was not paid out of higher taxes but from debt.


So a priori as long as it’s not financed through printing new money it should not really have effect on inflation. Inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon.

Also, yes it’s a redistribution mechanism like most of the things that UK government does. Any policy that uses government funds as a transfer to others, or fund non-public good services (like NHS for example) is a redistributive measure.
",Accepted,"It seems you are not confused about part (1) because that's exactly what it means.

Lexicographic preferences are monotone. Monotonicity means more is better. If I have more of every good in the bundle, then I like that bundle more. This is still true for lexicographic preferences, even though parts of the bundle may not matter. A condition for monotonicity is e.g. that (5,4) is preferred to (3,1). In other words if 5>3 and 4>1 then the first bundle is preferred. This is true for lexicographic preferences.

Your definitions of strict monotonicity and lexicographic preferences seem to deviate a bit from conventional definitions though. Here is a proof using your definitions.

Proof:

Let us compare two bundles with $n$ elements each: $x=(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ and $y=(y_1, y_2, ...,y_n)$

It is best to start with the if statement when going about proving such claims. The condition and therefore starting point is $x_1&gt;y_1$ and $x_2&gt;y_2$, .... , and $x_n&gt;y_n$.

In that case since  $x_1&gt;y_1$ we have according to your preference definition that bundle $x$ is preferred to bundle $y$. Furthermore we have that bundle $y$ is not preferred to bundle $x$. So bundle $x$ is strictly preferred.

Hence, we have shown that if $x_i$>$y_i$ for each $i$, then $x$ is preferred (because in that case $x_1 &gt; y_1$), which is your definition of monotonicity. The preferences are therefore monotonic.

35898,Why won't the Federal Reserve's 2020 quantitative easing cause hyperinflation like in 1921-1923 Weimar Republic?,"Pls ELI5. 2013 was last time I opened macroeconomics textbook! I just have a B.A. economics.

On r/Economics, u/ComfortableCold9 asked


  From your point of view, at what point would we [the USA in 2020] be approaching weimar? A QE program of 15 trillion? 25 trillion?


Right under, u/Bumblewurth answered


  From my point of view, never. What made hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic and (most other regimes with hyperinflation) was printing marks to pay debts in gold. The whole point of QE is to provide liquidity (already there) and to prevent deflation/meet inflation targets (not there yet.) If we're at QE with 25 trillion it's because we still haven't seen inflation in consumer prices.
  
  Inequality will be through the roof though as asset prices inflate.


u/Bumblewurth answers u/ComfortableCold9's follow-ups quoted in line.


  
    [u/ComfortableCold9 :] So seeing as we pay our debts in dollar, that suggests to me that we are effectively reliant on the dollar maintaining its strength
  
  
  [u/Bumblewurth :] No we aren't. If the dollar falls, the debts fall with the dollar. That's the difference between hyperinflationary economies in the past with non-sovereign debt and modern economies with sovereign debt. You aren't printing more dollars to chase the same amount of gold.
  
  
    But as soon as we start to see a level of inflation that would warrant a massive QT program, the economy would be held hostage.
  
  
  Economy is held hostage with deflation risk already. There's risk everywhere. That's life. But QE won't cause hyperinflation, just a whole lot of asset inflation and inequality.
  
  Most of this could be avoided if we weren't so tepid about using fiscal policy or if the fed had a fiscal tool to just send checks to everyone to manage deflation. Monetary policy is pushing on a string. But congress won't act, so here we are; Just like in 2008.



Like u/ComfortableCold9 below, I too ""don't see a difference""? 
I don't understand Bumblewurth's distinction between ""future obligations"" and ""current debts"". ""Current debts are wiped out when you monetize them"" — So what? 



  
    [u/ComfortableCold9 :] I don't see a difference here; if the dollar started to lose lose strength, you would have to print more dollars to get the same value of what you're buying.
  
  
  Yes, that's a concern for future obligations, not current debts. Current debts are wiped out when you monetize them. But once you get inflation you stop QE because the entire point of QE is to create inflation so that demand is at productive capacity. You aren't printing money to cover obligations and then printing ever more to cover the same obligations as your currency falls. You're printing more to prevent deflation. That's the point. QE and Weimar aren't related.

",35916,"If you want something ""even more ELI5"", try this from the Atlantic:


  Let me unpack these one by one. Right now getting the markets to buy our debt isn't the problem. Getting enough debt for the markets to buy is the problem. Investors are so crazy to load up on Treasuries that they're actually paying us to borrow, taking inflation into account. But while we're currently getting free money from investors, Hungary circa 1945 was getting no money. It was an investment pariah. If Hungary wanted to rebuild its economy, its only recourse was the printing press.    
  
  Second, the United States isn't really printing money. At least not like post-war Hungary. Quantitative easing is usually described as ""money-printing"" but it's not really. QE involves the Fed buying longer-term bonds from banks. It simply swaps one asset for another -- in this case, cash for longer-term bonds. Unlike Hungary, the Fed isn't directly paying the Treasury's bills. This is a hugely important distinction.
  
  Whatever money the Fed ""prints"" is stuck in the banks. That money isn't inflationary as long as the banks don't lend it out. What if the banks do start lending at a faster clip? The Fed can still effectively pay the banks not lend by, for example, raising the interest on excess reserves or require the banks to set aside more money. It would be shocking for the Fed not to pursue one of these options.
  
  Third, the most important difference between us and post-war Hungary or Weimar is that our roads haven't been razed to the ground and half the country isn't striking. It's very difficult to have hyperinflation when you still have a functioning economy. Almost all examples of hyperinflation result from huge economic shocks that devastate an economy so much that leaders think printing money is the only solution to growth. As bad as the Great Recession has been, our GDP is already back to and above its all-time pre-recession high. As bad as unemployment is, more than 80 percent of the labor force is working. In Zimbabwe, 80 percent of the population was unemployed.
  
  Let's conclude with a modest proposal for an economic corollary to Godwin's Law. The first person to reference Weimar's hyperinflation in an economic debate automatically loses.


Yeah, it was written in 2012... Nowadays there are some fears (time will tell if justified) that people returning from the lockdowns [when those end] will cause ""unexpected"" inflation. But that's a different story, not really about QE.

And if you want more recent data on where US inflation is headed, ""this just in"":


  U.S. consumer prices fell by the most in more than five years in March and further decreases  are likely as the novel coronavirus outbreak suppresses demand for some goods and services, offsetting price increases related to shortages resulting from disruptions to the supply chain.
  
  The Labor Department said on Friday its consumer price index dropped 0.4% last month amid a tumble in the costs of gasoline, hotel accommodation, apparel and airline tickets. That was the biggest drop since January 2015 and followed a 0.1% gain in February. 
  
  The general price level decline is expected even as the Federal Reserve has adopted extraordinary measures to stop the economy’s free-fall. [...]
  
  “The disinflationary impulse, along with the great disruption in economic and financial market activity, is a key reason why the Fed is unleashing vast new monetary policy stimulus,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. [...]

35943,Does Federal Reserve's purchase of junk bonds create unethical incentives and moral hazard?,"On Apr 9 2020, the Fed for the First Time Can Buy Junk Bonds. That Should Help ‘Fallen Angels.’


  The Federal Reserve is making its first-ever foray into the junk-rated corporate bond market, saying it will consider buying noninvestment-grade corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds.
  
  As part of an effort to make available \$2.3 trillion in new loans amid the coronavirus crisis, the central bank said Thursday that it would buy the bonds of “fallen angel” companies, or companies that get downgraded from investment grade to junk. Companies will qualify if they had an investment-grade rating on March 22 and have since been downgraded to one of the top three tiers of the high-yield bond market (BB+, BB or BB-).


Bloomberg has a title ""Moral Hazard"".  Can't companies ""leverage themselves into oblivion and when they all [fail] the Fed will just buy their worthless bonds""?


  But the nature of the Fed’s actions pass the traditional boundaries of the central bank to purchase lower-rated debt and the credit of municipalities, raising questions about its future role.
  
  ”That does present some moral hazard but a lot will depend on how these programs are executed and how they’re unwound,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. “Are they executed in a way that doesn’t unduly benefit people? If the programs are devised effectively, hopefully that won’t be the case.”


Are these Reddit comments below correct? I edited r/economics.


  Let’s call it what it is, junk bonds. They don’t care about municipalities, this is buying up corporate garbage debt to bail out the rich. Corporate bonds was bad enough, junk bonds are straight garbage that WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RISKY so why is the Fed buying it. This is no benefit to Main St. at all. If your argument was the municipalities need to issue debt to function and this helps grease that market, the right answer is that municipalities that cannot clearly afford projects should not issue debt. Let’s be honest, boomers had so much money they threw it at high yield, enjoyed the gains but now it’s garbage so the taxpayer is bailing them out.
  
  This is the end of capitalism and free markets. You could argue that a few banks were too big to fail, maybe they should have. Now you are talking about 100’s of companies like Best Buy and Macy’s that we’re already doing bad so we are throwing cash at them in the form of loans and also bailing out their debt to people who shouldn't have bought it. Don’t forget how much these CEOs and boards make.
  
  I hate to be political but let’s remember T[ARP] actually made money, it was risky but the QE was limited in amount and by assets that were “good”. Look at the group of individuals in charge now and their financial history, the idea that the Fed will get its money back is an absolute joke.
  
  Junk bonds are junk because they are risky.
  By definition they don't deserve to be saved by the government.
  
  Its purpose is to place cash on the balance sheets of organizations that invest in securities like junk bonds in the hopes that they will wake up and see credit risk and roll the cash into the stock market to bolster the President's re-election chances.
  
  [Source] Buying junk bonds is stupid - these shitty companies are all getting free money from the fed while at the same time laying off and furloughing millions of workers. Banks and other people with money then buy up ownership in these companies that won’t fail (arguably many should), benefiting from rising stock prices while the companies pay out no wages to workers. It’s all fake and will prop up the wealthy people who own businesses and leave the rest of America in line for food stamps. There is no reason for this insane rally in stock prices when upwards of 10 million Americans are unemployed.

",35945,"This is primarily to allow nationalisation of shale oil.
",Accepted,"The payment of interest is straightforward. The central bank is a bank, and pays interests on deposits in exactly the same way as any other bank.

If the central bank wants to pay $1 in interest to a depositor, it:


increases the amount on deposit by \$1 and
reduces the central bank's equity by $1.


That is, it just reshuffles the right hand side of the central bank's balance sheet; the asset side is unchanged. (On the income statement, there is a correpsonding $1 interest expense.)

All the central bank needs to do is ensure that the aggregate interest paid on reserves is less than the aggregate interest received from its lending and bond/bill holdings to prevent equity from going negative.

Since 100% of a central bank's assets pay interest, and its currency (dollar bills) do not, keeping the net interest flow positive is not too difficult (in a positive interest rate environment).

You asked what backs the currency. The answer is the taxing power of government. There's a few theoretical justifications for that statement, One is provided by Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (edge of mainstream), and another is referred to as ""neo-Chartalism"" (post-Keynesian).

As for the relationship between inflation and the rate of interest, the answer depends upon which school of economics you follow. Increasing interest rates increases the interest income of the private sector (which should increase effective demand, as you note), which is traded off by the effect on behaviour of the higher rate of interest. The conventional answer is that the behavioural effects dominate; that is, higher interest rates slow the economy and inflation.

34628,Why does global suspension of economic activity result in catastrophic loss/debt?,"Covid-19 has forced a suspension of at least 50% of financial transactions and business activities. 

Materially, not much has been lost: consumables have been spared, equipment is dormant, maintenance is mostly inexpensive. Why is the health crisis expected to bankrupt many businesses? Is most of the loss speculative?

Propery tax + land rental = 20-25% of yearly rent, so a landlord can waive rent for 6 months and still make profit! enough to pay 2 years of tax and maintenance. 

I naively imagine that using government moratoriums on bank-debt-interest rates and fees, It is possible for companies to organize a state of dormancy and maintenance for an extended period, without incurring significant loss. 

Can you give a summary of why it is not so simple, and why the losses are a lot worse than a financial and material dormancy? 
",34630,"It creates losses. 

First, many businesses don’t own their own building/land/equipment. It’s very common to lease these things. Moreover, many business take out insurance that again has to be paid on monthly basis. In Europe in many countries you need to pay workers certain portion of wages even when you can’t call worker to work or even if they stay home sick. 

The list here is not exclusive. The point is many business have non-trivial fixed costs that have to be payed whether business operates or it doesn’t. Furthermore, in short run even some variable costs - like wages to employees on production line are fixed (and in many countries this can be up to several months). Hence, it’s not like a dormant business have no costs. 

You might ask why then we don’t suspend for example these leases etc. but that just moves the problem to the different parties and does not eliminate this issue. 

Moreover, very large business might have enough financial cushion to absorb losses for few months, but there are many small-medium size business that can’t do that. For example, consider a sole trader (a form of business organization where one person embodies a business) who has a repair shop with no employees just living month to month. That kind of businessman can not afford to go on hiatus for very long.

Furthermore, if by long you mean not just weeks but several months or even year that would be issue even for the best cushioned business.

So yes the impact could be catastrophic. For example according to this VOX blog the impact under some scenarios could be worse than recent 2008 crisis.

35797,How likely is a total economic collapse due to the potential coronavirus impact?,"Most signs show that lockdown could easily stretch through the summer. A freeze in consumer spending would cause multiple industries to fail causing a ripple effect.

To be specific, if lockdown lasts through the summer, and a second virus wave occurs in the fall as expected, then lockdowns will continue further into the year. The timeframe for a vaccine is 12-18 months earliest. Then, the vaccine must be manufactured and distributed. Since the virus is so widespread that it is now assumed that it will reach a global critical mass, this essentially guarantees the collapse of the restaurant, airline, tourism, and hotel industries as they cannot sustain prolonged losses in a capitalistic structure. If they fail, their suppliers fail, and so on. History has shown that large systems are prone to failure time and time again, esp. when accountability is obfuscated (e.g. the Titanic, the World Wars/Holocaust, and now this). In the past Egypt fell, and then Rome fell. What is to say our current systems won’t fail, even if as a slowly sinking ship?

He has confirmed that a potential collapse is possible as another 47 million Americans may become jobless - this is unprecedented and would be absolutely devastating to American civilization.
",35809,"As a disclaimer, this is not an answer, rather a long-form explanation of the difficulties of answering.

The first leg is uncertainty about the danger of the epidemic. Economists are not medical experts. For example, one could imagine that there is an amazing breakthrough where a common medicine saves patients. The economic effects of that scenario are very different than the scenarios presented by governments. More realistically, we do not know how strong activity restrictions have to be to control the epidemic.

The next leg of uncertainty is the government response. Governments have the capacity to bail out entities (firms, households) that get in trouble. We do not know what they will do.

Even if we knew all that, there is uncertainty about the best model that takes all this in. It is very unusual for governments to restrict economic activity in such a broad-based manner, and so there are no standard models. (There is a flood of research.)

Finally, “conventional” economics does not really spend much time looking into societal collapse scenarios. There are areas of academia that do this, and there is presumably studies in economic history. Experts in those subject areas are not normally visiting this website.

35861,How does the Federal Reserve unwind the asset purchasing scheme announced in response to the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic?,"On Monday, 06 April, 2020 the Financial Times reported that the Federal Reserve balance sheet could increase to $9 trillion.  This is partly due to the myriad of initiatives, some new, to protect the economy of the United States during the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic.  

A lot of online commentary is alarmist and centres on the threat of hyperinflation and many of the news articles don't inform the reader how the Federal Reserve purchases assets.. This puts the average citizen at a disadvantage when understanding the economic impact.  

My question is multi-faceted (but singlular) and aiming to focus purely on the economics.


How does the Federal Reserve unwind the positions on their books?  Do financial services have to purchase the assets back at a later date and does the Federal Reserve charge a premium for the service?
Can a position of this size (60% of national output) actually be unwound?


If this question is similar to the approaches of other Central Banks then please tag accordingly if appropriate.  
",35864,"The unwind depends upon what the central bank did.


If the central bank did a repurchase agreement (“repo”) or lent against assets for a fixed time, the agreement automatically unwinds at the term of the deal (which is short). They would need to enter into new deals to keep their balance sheet size unchanged.
If they bought the asset outright, it will either mature, or the central bank can sell ahead of maturity.


There are no “charging a premium” involved; the cost of the operation is embedded in the lending cost (or purchase/sales price of an asset).

There was a very large debate about unwinding central bank balance sheets in the 2010-2016 (?) period. The Fed was eventually able to slowly reduce the size of its balance sheet in the last cycle, and there is no reason to believe that this time is different. There is no sign that an “unwind” was necessary, nor are the effects of unwinding a deep concern.
",Reasonable,"You can visually inspect for heteroscedasticity in the disturbances by plotting the regression residuals against the fitted values and then checking if you can discern some pattern to the spread of the residuals in the scatterplot. The idea here is that the variance (spread) of heteroscedastic errors $\varepsilon_i$, conditional on the explanatory variables $X_i$, is not constant:

$$ Var(\varepsilon_i | X_i) \neq \sigma^2.$$

You can also explicitly test for heteroscedasticity in a linear regression by using statistical tests such as Breusch-Pagan or White.

I am training for a powerlifting competition and do not have my own 20kg bar and certainly don't have 200kg worth of plates to continue practising deadlifts and squats.

What is the best way to continue making progress on strength for deadlifts and squats?
",41768,"I'm sorry, but realistically, you can't.

That being said, if you look at the range of different ""fitness"" qualities (endurance, power, strength, flexibility, etc), strength is generally the last one to go, and it's also one of the easiest to get back once you've initially built it.

There are some things you can try, there is going to be some carry over from bodyweight exercises to the traditional powerlifts (though obviously not as much as training the lifts). Things like dips and pull ups to strengthen the triceps and back. You can do core work because a stronger core is always a good thing. Pistol squats, while not the same as a loaded barbell squat, will allow you to keep training your legs.

Also, now is the perfect time to address all those little niggles and flexibility issues that you've been ignoring. That tight hip, the knee that aches if you keep it in the same position too long, the shoulder that's a little wonky, everything like that.

Fingers crossed, by fixing the little bits and throwing in some bodyweight stuff now, you'll be able to come back stronger (figuratively speaking) when you're able to get back to training.

",41757,"Unfortunately, unless you have a good home gym set up, you aren't going to be able to carry on with the StrongLifts program.

Sorry, but that's just the way it is.

Now, focusing on the positive, there are a large number of home training options available, depending on what you're willing to invest in and what space you have available.

I like kettlebells, so I own a few of them and can get a good training session in with swings, Turkish get-ups, presses, goblet squats and loaded carries.

Likewise, bodyweight, you can get a good session in with press ups (since you mentioned you've got bad wrists, you can invest in some push up handles, or can you do push ups on your dumbbells?), pull ups, single leg squat variations, planks and Romanian deadlifts using a box full of books (ok, it's not bodyweight, but you get the idea).

Being outside in nature is always a good thing, so load up a backpack with some weight and go for a walk (technically called ""rucking""). While you're at it, occasionally press the bag overhead, or carry it one side or the other, bear hug it to your chest, just play with the position to stress your muscles.

If you've only been training for a few weeks, chances are that you'll still gain strength from any sort of training, provided you don't slack off. No, it won't be StrongLifts style training, but stronger is stronger, having a solid core is always a good thing and helps with the powerlifts. Basically, improvise!
",Reasonable,"How can I avoid such feelings while still studying well and not gaining a lot weight?

Well, studying also use calories. With that said, instead of consuming more food, try drinking more water to fill you up. Sometimes, its not hunger. Since you mention lack of energy and have some headache, try taking a break once in a awhile by taking a short nap, taking a slow walk and etc.

Is it because of enjoyment (sad or at least normal non-excited people don't like too much eating) or it is because math is harder?

39689,How to get 5-year-old to consistently cover mouth when couging?,"My 5-year-old son started developing a dry cough yesterday (yay...).  He has trouble remembering to cover his mouth when he coughs, despite our reminding him every time he does it, and despite in the past during extended illnesses him finally catching on after our repeating reminders.

Given the possibility of COVID-19 being the cough source, we want to extra make sure the cause of his cough is spread as little through the house as possible.  Is there a way to quickly and effectively get him in the habit of covering his mouth the moment he feels a cough or sneeze coming on?
",39690,"Getting someone into the habit of doing anything requires repetition, as that is what a habit is largely: a settled or regular tendency or practice.  

The best way to establish a habit in a child from my experience is to gently remind them to do the habitual action immediately after the ""cue"" for the action.  In this case, it would be to:


Hear your child cough
If they didn't cover: Remind them to cover their mouth
Praise them for covering their mouth


The praise is appropriate either if they did cover their mouth, or if they didn't but they covered their mouth when you told them to (yes, this is pointless, but it establishes the habit).  

There are some more rigorous explanations of this method, such as here; that site goes into some detail about the relationship between ""cue"", ""routine"", and ""reward"".  

It's not something that will happen instantly, but it does work over time.  The key is not to be upset when they fail - don't be negative about it at all.  Just be positive.  Polite reminder to do the action (don't forget to cover your mouth!), praise for doing it (good job covering your mouth), and then repeat!
",Accepted,"Don't talk - just act:

Every time the child is coughing without hiding his face in the elbow - not covering the face with the hand, because the virus can be spread by hand shake and then having contact with hands in the face (nose, mouth openings)  - you can order quarantine in the children room.

If you don't act like this your child and yourself and the whole nation will be in a shut down and national quarantine sooner as you think. And then you will have time for discussions and explanations. (And then the children and all others too will be habit.) 

If we were in a war the authorities would activate the sirens now. This is not the time of apocalyptics but it is the only chance to stop the spreading of this virus and to keep the hospital beds free for people who need it. 

The other alternative would be that everyone has to cough with open mouth that all are infected as soon as possible with probably thousands of deaths. When everyone is infected the virus can't spread any more.

Edit 1:

We all know that it - covering the face, but not with the hand - should work like an unconditioned reflex. But at it is not unconditioned it has to be conditioned.  There are 2 ways: 


reinforcement of the goal behavior (that’s what Joe describes)
or negative consequences = “punishment” of the wrong behavior  (the alternative we don’t prefer)


Edit 2:

My answer 3 days ago was a time out in his room every time the child forgets to cover his face. 3 days we are at the point that all children, coughing are not, can‘t see their grand parents for weeks. And people elder than 65 years are asked to stay inside. A week ago we still were shopping and met young mothers with 4 children in the super market running around. Meanwhile this is forbidden and teenagers are punished if they are in groups outside. Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria ...

Children are not victims of this virus but they can be infected and spread and there is no time to loose! No time to wait for developing habits. Also in the USA they will be isolated or walk around with a mask.

Edit 3:

After the discussion about “praise” vs. “punishment” (s.comments below) I’ve edited  “punishment” = negative consequences. OP clearly says that he has remembered the child (5 years!). He should have learnt it with 3 years. 

Btw. I’d like to emphasize that I wrote “wrong” behavior and not “bad”. Unfortunately “punishment” and “praise” is always associated with good and bad. Consequences should be logical (positive or negative).

It is clear that children - and adults! with naive stereotypes  consider negative consequences = punishment. (Look at the religions: negative consequences lacking of hygiene are interpreted as punishment of the gods. Same problem we have with our bad! dealing and habits with our environment and animals.)

",39704,"First of all, recognize that your concerns may not be the same as your four year old's concerns. This has two implications:


Your child may be worried about things you couldn't have thought of. Your child is likely shielded from or doesn't understand a lot of what's going on, and that can also mean that they don't have access to bits of information that would actually be reassuring. Encourage your child to ask questions about corona, so that they're not left to ponder on their own things that may seem frightening.
You are likely worrying about outcomes your child has no thought of. Try not to pass on your own fears to your child. If pre-school is closed and one parent has to stay home from work to care for the child, recognize that this may be viewed as a mainly positive outcome to the child.


With my three year old, I emphasize that all closures and restrictions (writing from Sweden, we're not currently in full lockdown) are not - ultimately - to protect us from disease, but to protect our elderly from catching it from us. I find that framing to be appealing because it's both true, and I imagine it's less scary to a young child to hear how we all have to chip in and make sacrifices to protect another group, than to convey an image that it's actually unsafe for them to step outside.

Why we should wash our hands and what's so good about vaccines are some things we talk about normally, and the current situation is a good opportunity to put that into context. You can say that it is to avoid this that we vaccinate against a lot of other things, and that scientists are working on a vaccine against this too. That perhaps once your kid will have children of their own, and they will receive a corona vaccine as well in the routine program, and your child will be able to tell their children how they remember what it was like before the vaccine. Washing hands has been a constant battle. Now we've introduced a longer routine, which involves singing a 20-second-long song, and compliance has (temporarily, I assume) increased.

Consider whether you are changing your own behavior in a manner which may require explanation. For instance, if you are suddenly buying groceries in conspicuously larger quantities than normal, or even if they may have seen the images of empty shelves, you may want to point out that you and others are trying to reduce your number of trips to the grocery store, and hence the number of chances you may infect some at-risk person, lest they think that you're actually going to run out of food.

As an adult, it's easy to become consumed by this. We like to stay updated about what's going on in the world, and this is certainly a main event, and a rapidly evolving one. For my own sake, I could easily bingewatch news for the greater part of the day, and spend the remainder hypothesizing over different future scenarios. Recognize that a young child's world is smaller than yours. Talk about it as a thing that's happening right now, but make sure most of your interactions revolve around normal day to day activities. The above is addressing your question, how to talk about corona, but also make sure you don't talk exclusively about corona.

The best way to do this would be the legal route, unless you greatly expect that she will happily let you have full custody, not wanting to see the kids for them, or out of spite against you. 

Any evidence you can get will be very useful. The maid may be able to support what you say, depending on how open your wife is with her mistreatment of the kids. I'd also suggest trying to get some video or audio recordings, but you should look into whether these can be used in court if the other person is not aware that they are being recorded. 

In terms of the kitchen, I suggest kid-proofing it. Try to store any dangerous items out of their reach, and any low cupboards that need to store dangerous items should have childproofing locks.

39769,How to minimize covid-19 exposure child visitation with the non-custodial parent?,"What practical approaches are recommended or possible to minimize covid-19 exposure during child visitation, weekend visit, with the non-custodial parent?  Are there medical or legal guidelines on this topic?  (I live in Georgia, in the USA.)
",39770,"First: we are not able to answer legal questions, so don't take this as really addressing the legal side of things.  Look up those details in your area specifically or ask a lawyer for that.

In general, visitation is likely still possible currently.  See this advice from Nolo:


  How do Social Distancing Rules Affect Custody Arrangements?
  
  
    The social distancing and shelter-in-place rules don't directly affect custody orders, so you should continue following your current custody arrangement unless you and your ex agree to an alternative plan or a judge changes your custody order.
    
    Courts are making it clear that disobeying court orders or withholding visitation during this time won't be tolerated and may result in contempt of court. But if you have valid concerns about your child's health and safety, you can try communicating with your ex to see what you can both do to reduce the risks to your child.
    
    Within a family unit, creating an effective social distancing plan can be as simple as adopting rules for parents and children to follow within their home. But for divorced or separated parents, social distancing and staying healthy when children are going back and forth between two households can be challenging.
  


An example of a state issuing guidance on this is Delaware:


  To be clear, neither the State of Emergency nor the Seventh Modification interferes with or invalidates any existing Family Court order regarding custody or visitation. Custody and visitation orders remain in full force and effect. Travel (including interstate travel) for the purposes of complying with a Family Court order is considered essential travel and permitted. Such travel was deemed essential in Governor Carney’s Fifth Modification to the COVID-19 State of Emergency Declaration issued March 22, 2020. Under the Seventh Modification, such travel remains essential and is excluded from the selfquarantine requirement. 


CNN indicates that some states have more vague language, however:


  Other states have left rulings vague. In Massachusetts, for example, John D. Casey, chief justice of probate and family court, last week issued an open letter that said, ""both parents should cooperate.""


Some states are apparently encouraging (but not requiring) virtual visitation, such as Vermont:


  How is the Department for Children and Families dealing with social distancing?
  
  
    According to Johnson, DCF has called its families to ask if they would be willing to have virtual visitations.
  


That all said: you should consider the risks that visitation would bring.  If your child, or anyone in either household, is in the 'high risk' category, for example a child who is immunocompromised due to medication, or an elderly parent living at home with the family, it may be appropriate to limit or eliminate in person visitation.  That would depend on an agreement between the two parents, though, to modify the arrangements temporarily; it would not be automatic.

It is highly recommended to have a conversation with your ex-partner, and be clear about your concerns and open to creative ideas.  It may be safer to have fewer handoffs for longer periods of time - if it is normally 5 days / 2 days, then perhaps 3 weeks / 1 week is possible, for example, if the normally noncustodial parent is not working or is working at home and able to spend time with the child.  The linked CNN article above has more recommendations along these lines.  

Facetime/Skype/Zoom/etc. are good options for maintaining contact with the child without personal contact.  Many activities can take place over videochat; reading a book to them, playing a board game virtually (one person moves pieces for the other player of course; or some games, like Battleship, can be played completely remotely); online games, of course, as well.  
",Reasonable,"If your child has a subject they are really interested in and you can build something related to that subject from the Lego that you already have, then you can use the second hand Lego Technic to your advantage.

See if you can locate an image and possibly a building description of the item that interests your child and then create your own (overcomplete?) set of Lego in a box of your own design.

That way, you have turned your second-hand Lego sets into something unique and if your child asks why the gift wasn't bought in a store/in a box from Lego, then your answer can be that it doesn't even exist in the store. That unique is the gift.

And remember, opening the box on something new can only be done once. After that, it would be the same as opening the box on a re-packaged second-hand item, even if the toy was brand new the day before.

115220,What is a likely cause of this glow in my photos?,"I have been using a Nikon D5200 with a Tamron 100-400 zoom for wildlife photography. It's admittedly a budget setup (in some sense of the term ""budget""), so I don't expect amazing results. I'm also not a trained photographer, and I've pretty much learned by reading the internet and youtube (not ideal, I know). Recently, I decided to rent a different Nikon body for an expedition (which ultimately got canceled due to COVID-19).

I decided to rent a mirrorless Nikon Z6 to see how I would like a mirrorless camera, and to try a full-frame sensor, and also just to get a newer sensor and body and see how the quality compares, using the same Tamron lens.

I made a lot of mistakes in using the new body, but ultimately I'm stumped still. The photos are displaying the same annoying glow that I've seen with the old body. I don't know what is causing it, but it seems like I can narrow it down to ""operator"" or lens errors.



In the image above, a heavily cropped section of a photo of a bird, you can see the glow. It shows up similarly using either body. This is shot at 400mm, ISO 320 f/6.3, 1/500 sec. 

I handhold the camera most of the time because I just can't use a tripod for most of these photos (the birds are up in a tree, jumping around, etc.)

Does anyone have any suggestions for what I should do here? Should I use faster shutter speed and higher ISO? I've tried that and found that I get a lot of noise, but maybe the newer sensors can handle it? I'd be willing to spend some $$ on a book or read any references people might recommend. 

Thanks!

EDIT
This image is uncorrected, straight out of the camera, though (sadly) I took it as a JPG originally. I usually shoot raw, but had my settings incorrect for this new body that I'm renting. I see the same effect whether it's RAW or JPG though, it was just that this photo showed the effect more strongly so that I could illustrate my question.

See https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F19315.

It's not clear to me why they would care about the proof of your whereabouts, but there is a requirement to apply for the card within 90 days of your arrival in France.  If you apply after 90 days, the cost rises from €25 to €340.  If you apply within 90 days but they drag their feet, the cost should remain €25, so, because you moved in October and applied in October, you should be paying the lower fee.  There is no other penalty for a late application; in particular, you cannot be deported.

You write:


  We traveled inside Europe from the time we arrived in the summer of 2015 until we moved into our new house in France in October of 2016 (15 months). I did not secure a residency permit anywhere, because we were staying with friends and didn't really have a permanent residence. Perhaps I should have applied for the CDS when we signed for the house in January 2016, even though we really weren't staying in France for extended periods. Just trying to find out if it's going be surmountable after all this time.


Yes, it will be surmountable.  As mentioned, the only real question is whether to charge you €25 or €340.  I do not know exactly what criteria they would use to assert that you owe the higher fee, however.  If you were never in France for more than 90 days, then they probably cannot charge the higher fee.  If you were in France for more than 90 days, uninterrupted, before filing your application, then they certainly can charge you the higher fee.  If you were in France for more than 90 days, and then left, and then moved to France, they might argue that the higher fee is due, and although I doubt that this would stand up in court, the cost of a court battle is not justified by the €315 difference.

The 90 day period is triggered by your arrival in France, not your purchase of property.  If you were based in France for your 15-month travels in Europe, then you should arguably have applied for the card then; a short trip away from France would generally be held not to interrupt your period of residence.  On the other hand, if you were in France for just a few days, but spent most of your time in Germany or indeed anywhere else in the world, it would be difficult to argue that you had established yourself in France at that point or that your period of residence should be said to have started then.  In any event, their interest in your whereabouts seems consistent with an inquiry into whether to charge the higher fee, but whether that is the real reason or not is still unclear.

It seems, however, that your major worry is whether they can deny the carte de séjour altogether.  In general, they cannot.

More precisely, they can deny it only on very limited grounds, which almost certainly do not apply.  The grounds are:


Your husband is not an EU citizen
Your marriage to your husband is not valid
You and your husband, as ""economically inactive"" people, are not able to support yourselves
You or your husband are a danger to public health
You or your husband are a danger to public safety
Your or your husband's presence in France is contrary to public policy


The third item, being able to support yourselves, is only necessary for the first five years; after that time, you gain a right of permanent residence in France.

",Reasonable,"The previous green card can be deemed void because she will be presumed to have abandoned it because she was away for more than a year without a reentry permit. The social security number however is valid for life.

Nevertheless, if she enters using her green card the worst the immigration officer can do is refer her to immigration court. They cannot turn her away. It is only an immigration judge who has that authority to declare definitively that the permanent residence was abandoned

Note that the determination of abandonment by the immigration officer at the airport is discretionary. There is no defined time period after which when a person is away they are determined to have definitely abandoned residence. They are presumed to have abandoned after one year away however if they can provide evidence to show it was out of their control, the immigration judge can make a ruling that they did not intend to abandon it and hence reinstate it.

I personally know someone who returned after almost two years and was let in. The immigration officer didn’t even interrogate in-depth why he was away almost two years. He never filed the reentry permit document to protect his residency or got an SB-1.

In this case I don’t think you want to drag your child through immigration court just to save $1500 or so. Additionally the 5 years absence was prolonged so prospects of winning in immigration court are low.

The problem however is even though she has a nonimmigrant visa, if she enters using the visa she can be turned away at the airport if they dig a little because they can reasonably assume she has immigrant intent and that she is only coming on the visa for convenience and you will file for her when she arrives. That will cause major problems for you. Also remember you will have to wait some months after she arrives before filing for her because of the 90 day rule.


  90-Day Rule
  
  Although USCIS has not updated their Policy Manual with a similar
  rule, adjustment of status applicants would be prudent to assume the
  same guideline is in place. For example, many attorneys are now
  advising their clients to avoid marriage and adjustment of status
  within at least the first 90 days of entry.


CONCLUSION


She should formally abandon the permanent residence, then enter on the visa. If questioned she will have to say she’s only visiting her parents. Then 91 days later, you can file a new permanent residence application for her.
Alternatively you can let her wait in India while you petition her from scratch and not use the nonimmigrant visa because technically it would be fraudulent to enter with a nonimmigrant visa knowing full well you are going to adjust status.

I am French, living in Spain and my boyfriend is American living in NYC. He has his own business with his brother and before we met they already wanted to expand the business (creams and body care oils) to Europe. 

He wanted to hire a person to be in charge of all the translation work, calls, emails and European marketing in general for Europe. I don't want to go to the US, I am fine here in Spain but we found it stupid to hire someone to do this job when I am actually a teacher and translator here in Spain.

After all this, the idea is to come back before next summer as I plan to open my little language school and he plans to open another store here in Spain.

Can he hire me even if I am his girlfriend? Nothing is official we are neither married nor pareja de hecho as we call it here. If he puts an offer online and present my resume etc for H1B visa, in the case to be approved (which I doubt with all this Corona virus thing), am I able to tell the embassy he is my boyfriend ?

",Reasonable,"Summary

Currently there are no real negatives to gaining Irish Citizenship, other than:


The cost and hassle of registration on the foreign births register.
The Cost of your first passport.
Renewal fees for your passport renewals on expiry every 10 years.


Background

According to The Wikipedia article on The Irish Diaspora there are about 3 million people living outside of Ireland with Irish citizenship.

Additionally, the Irish Times indicates that up to 6 million people in Britain could be eligible for Irish Citizenship. (The actual number may be lower.)

Given that Ireland has only 4.7 million residents in the country, they have great infrastructure for supporting citizens abroad. 

To answer your specific questions:


There has never been conscription to the Irish military, other than when enforced by the British. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Ireland for more history.
You will only need to register for tax if you're resident/ordinarily resident/domiciled in Ireland. http://irishabroad.com/Irish-World/Expats/Moving-to-Ireland/Working/taxation/ has more information.
If you do have to register for tax in Ireland, it has an extensive network of Tax Treaties that would stop double taxation: http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/law/tax-treaties.html has more information.


Areas which may need investigation


I'm unsure of the implications for inheritance tax. I expect that since neither you nor your family would be resident in Ireland it wouldn't be relevant.
You might have some complications if you buy Irish Funds, stocks, property, or open bank accounts there. They could have specific rules that cover your situation. However, if you are ""just a citizen"" but have no other real relationship with the financial/property system you should not have to register with the Irish tax system at all.

Can you identify what type this burger is from the description on the menu?

Note: The full name of the penta-decker burger contains layers 1-5 from left to right.

Hint:


   Eating the Penta-decker Vowelburger™ is like eating 5 regular* Vowelburgers™ merged with each other; in other words, the top of the first layer is the bottom of the next.

*The word ""regular"" here means a bottom bun, single patty, and a top bun.


Hint 2:


   Each layer comes with lots of add-ons; those add-ons will be discarded, though, since we don't want the burger to get too high. From each layer, we extract only the simple Vowelburger™ from the bottom. (Note: the bottom is the left side of the word.)

Is there a recommended technique for propagating it myself so I don't run out, and have enough to share?
",105999,"Absolutely there is a way to propagate yeast, it's as simple as making a starter with it. Most of the time these days people create starters for sourdough using natural yeasts, but you can use them to feed any kind of yeast. All you would do is put flour and water in a container with some yeast, let it get to work and once you start to get bubbles put it in the fridge to slow it down. You would then use half of it for every batch of bread you make, replacing the flour and water to keep it at the same quantity. 

If you don't use any of it for a few days you'd want to throw half away and refill in order to give the yeast a fresh supply of food. You can share this with as many people as you like, just split it into two, give each a fresh supply of flour and water, and repeat as many times as necessary. Using this technique a small amount of yeast could theoretically supply the entire planet. 

NOTE: During the Coronavirus outbreak it's worth noting that corona can survive on surfaces for quite some time, so you should take great care to ensure that your yeast propagation does not lead to virus propagation!

120858,"If a broad long-term investment in the stock market is such a good deal, why don't banks do the ""obvious"" things?","There is a fundamental discrepancy or paradox that has been keeping myself, and many others, away from the stock market. Before I explain it, let me mention some selected popular questions on this site in which the consensus is that in the long term a broad investment in the stock market will yield a substantially positive average annual return rate:

Why should we expect stocks to go up in the long term?

Why do people claim that Stock Markets are broadly exponential in the long term?

Why isn't everybody rich?

Stock market long term risks

Is it a lie that you can easily make money passively in the stock market?

Are Index Funds really as good as “experts” claim?

In view of all this consensus, we can almost say that it has become ""common knowledge"" that investing in the broad stock market (sufficient diversification) on a long term perspective (several decades) is a very good investment strategy. More precisely, the consensus seems to be that there is some average annual return rate, say 3% (replace this number by something higher/lower if you prefer), such that if your investment is diversified enough and your timespan is long enough, the risk that your actual average annual return rate drops below that rate tends towards zero.

Now comes the first question: Why doesn't any (serious) bank offer a savings account with a fixed 2% interest rate for an unlimited amount of time? 

After all, a large bank has the optimal prerequisites for diversification and holding stocks for many decades, and if the above is true, then they would still earn at least 1% of their customer's account values each year by essentially doing not very much except buying and selling some index funds according to what customers want to withdraw or pay in. 

My own first objection to the question would be the following: If there is a market crash and at the same time a lot of customers want to withdraw money from their accounts, the bank might be in big trouble because the total value of the stocks owned by the bank could be less than what the customers want to withdraw.

However, I feel that this is not really an objection because even without the above ""obvious product"" banks will always be in trouble if their customers want to withdraw too much money at once. 

What's bothering me even more is the

Second question: Why don't all banks borrow a huge amount of money from the central bank and invest it in the stock market on a broad, long-term basis? 

As far as I know, banks can borrow money from the central bank at quite low interest rates (much less than the expected long-term average annual return rate of the broad stock market), in Europe that interest rate is currently even negative. So why don't all banks just buy index funds using this free money and just hold them forever, watching them grow in value?



Edit: After the first few answers (and some downvotes) I immediately realized that it was a big mistake to specialize the question in the sense that I only asked why banks don't do the ""obvious"" things, rather than having simply asked why no-one or  no specialized company does the ""obvious"" things. I am very glad that in the further course of events my question was received in a slightly more abstract way. Thank you all for your answers and upvotes, earning me a gold badge with my very first question on this site! If one could only trade in those badges for their real world counterparts... ;-)
",120859,"Fundamentally, I think there's a high level (and perhaps unsatisfying) answer to this. It's because that's not ""banking"" as a business, and a bank is established to do banking, not to get into the stock market. In other words, this question strikes me about the same as asking,


  why don't ice cream shops stop selling ice cream, and instead get in the business of selling pancakes? After all, you can make a lot of money selling pancakes.


Well yes, you can get rich selling pancakes, but not every business is a pancake shop. Certainly, some businesses get rich selling pancakes, but other businesses with different motivations and risk tolerances decide to sell ice cream instead.

To make this clear in your banking context: such a business would essentially be called a hedge fund or investment management company, not a bank. It's fine if a company wants to be a hedge fund, but a company that is calling itself a bank can't secretly switch over to being a hedge fund, and still call itself a bank while supporting ""banking"" activities for normal consumers.

From a more practical perspective, most jurisdictions have carefully developed regulations that would essentially prohibit a business calling itself a bank from doing what you're discussing. Essentially, these regulations exist because of my first point - the business model you're describing isn't ""banking."" And, regulations are designed around that, in the sense that regulations keep banks acting like banks and stop them from trying to act like something that isn't a bank.

I'm editing to clarify a portion of your question, as an example of this disconnect. You said,


  As far as I know, banks can borrow money from the central bank at quite low interest rates


That's not really the whole story. Think of it this way. Imagine if you were to walk into a retail bank right now, and ask for a loan for a million dollars. The bank would certainly ask you some questions, including asking what you intended to do with that money and how you could show proof that you are able to pay it back. If you were able to prove that you have a large and stable income, and that you were planning on using the million dollars to purchase a home that's actually worth a million dollars, you might get approved. But what if you told the bank, ""I'm actually empty handed, but I'm going to go invest this in the stock market, I think I have a proven way to make a positive return"" - they might deny you on the spot, or at least they might have a lot more questions for you!

The relationship between central banks and retail banks is fundamentally similar. A retail bank can't just call up the central bank and say, ""please wire me a billion dollars"" and instantly, the money shows up. Retail banks essentially have to go through a process of validating their operational intentions, showing proof that they can pay the loan back, and perhaps even putting up collateral, before the money changes hands. And, a retail bank with no collateral who indicated that they wanted to play the stock market would almost certainly get turned down by the central bank.

I'm making another edit to address another core flaw in your assumptions. You said,


  we can almost say that it has become ""common knowledge"" that investing in the broad stock market (sufficient diversification) on a long term perspective (several decades) is a very good investment strategy


While that may be a sound theory it's not a practical method for a bank to keep or invest assets, because of liquidity and predictability. It may be accurate to say that ""in the long term"" a diversified stock portfolio can be bulletproof. But banks can't issue cash to deposit customers based on long term theories. They have to be able to predict the availability of funds very well - the stability of their outcomes, not just the expected result. In other words, if a bank has $10 billion in assets, they need to know precisely how much of that will be available to them tomorrow, or next Tuesday, or in six months. Your stock market theory may have the right expected outcome (positive growth), but it's got far too much potential variance on any particular day. Yes, ""in the long run"" you may make money, but can you tell me exactly how much cash you'll have next Tuesday? No, you can't. You might have an acceptable expected outcome on Average for all ""next Tuesdays"" - but what if coronavirus takes off in the US this weekend? Or something else happens? Banks aren't just concerned about the expected outcome, they're also concerned about variability in the range of expected outcomes. People do ""banking activities"" like deposit their paycheck into a deposit account, or take out a credit card loan, with the expectation of stability and availability of funds. Those ""features"" which are essentially the definition of retail banking come as a trade off in terms of a slightly lower return (compared to your stock market portfolio).

No. The simple reason why is that even if you buy immediately when the market opens, that's still too late.

As an example, imagine that there's a single ETF which trades both in the United States (from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm US Eastern time) and in Great Britain (from 4:30 am to 11:00 am US Eastern time).

Now let's imagine that it's 4:30 am Eastern, and the ETF begins trading at $80. However, the price of the ETF increases over the course of the day, so that by 9:25 am Eastern, the price of the ETF is $100.

Can you take advantage of this by buying shares of the ETF in the United States immediately upon open? No, because when it starts trading in the United States, it will start trading at about $100, not at $80. You'll be paying $100 for shares worth $100, which is, of course, a profit of $0.

Maybe you're thinking that when the market opens, the opening price is the same as the previous day's closing price. This is not the case. The market won't open at $80 and then immediately rise to $100; it will simply open at $100.

I.e. I am not asking about the future development but rather about a comparison of the situation before the corona crisis to the present situation.

",121618,"It's unlikely that you would be able to have firm evidence of a sudden drop in price so rapidly. Reason for that is that the real estate market is a bit peculiar: Transactions take time to put together and it can take a long time for prices to adjust. The real estate market is not nearly as liquid as the stock market, international commodity markets or flower auctions.

When there is a real estate crash, it's common for the number of transactions to drop while buyers and sellers figure out the new price. Sellers, especially individuals who have a lot invested in their house, a (possibly underwater) mortgage to pay back, etc. are not ready to lower their asking price at once. Some might prefer to sell their house for the same price several years later rather than selling it at its real price right now. Buyers who are concerned about paying too much (like yourself) wait for the price to feel more reasonable relative to everything else. Those who need to sell a house before buying another one might also be stuck. And nobody knows exactly where the market might clear in between.

But, right now, you would not expect many real estate transactions to be happening in Europe. Real estate agencies are forced to close in several countries, it's not possible to visit houses, etc. So it's difficult to have any idea of what the current prices are, whether the drop in the number of transactions reflects a drop in the underlying market or is just a side-effect of the current measures to fight the pandemic, or how fast everything is going to go back to normal.

mostly with borrowed capital (around 80%)


This is too high in my opinion. There has been a period in history in Amsterdam when real house prices fell 80%, leaving only 20% (source). True, it happened over a period of 37 years (1778-1815). Shorter term crashes are usually more limited, easily leaving 50% of the house price value left. If you pay your loan back quickly, you could fund more than 50% of your house with borrowed capital. 60%? Definitely. 70%? Maybe if you pay your loan back very quickly. But I would not fund 80% with borrowed capital.


Is there any possibility of saying whether the crisis will have an impact on the real estate prices?


Anything is possible. In particular, investments (real estate, bonds, stocks) tend to be correlated. We now know that stock yields have increased and equivalently prices have reduced. Whether the same happens to real estate prices is anyone's guess.


Should I continue to buy the apartment as planned?


You should note that alternative investment options have reduced in value and increased in yield. For example, a major hydropower/nuclear power producing company in my area has a dividend yield of 8%. Add to that 2% of inflation, and you have 10% nominal yield. (It only distributes some of the earnings back as dividend, so part of it is reinvested, so the nominal yield could even exceed 10%).

So, do a quick calculation. How much yield would a stock investment have? How much yield would a real estate investment have (in avoided rental costs)? Take into account all estimated maintenance a real estate investment would have in a period of 50-100 years.

I can't say definite yes or no, but in the area where I live, the answer is a clear no. House prices would need to fall by a huge amount to make living in an owner-occupied house profitable, when considering alternative investments (stocks).

The danger in selling is that you may be following the pattern of many casual investors: fear of missing out drives them to buy stocks when the market is very strong and then fear of losing all drives them to sell when the market is very weak. They end up ""buying high and selling low"" which is a guaranteed way to lose money. 

On the other hand, if you do need the money in the near term, you pretty much have to accept the loss and sell. Whether you should sell now or a month from now is probably not answerable by anybody without a crystal ball.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the market has just received a solid wallop of information that a bunch of companies are not going to make nearly as much money this year as they thought they were. Some companies may experience a cash flow crisis that bankrupts them. If you own individual stocks and have the analysis skills, you might review your holdings and try to figure out if any of the companies you hold are in danger of going under. If your retirement is in index funds that you don't need for a few years, then I'd suggest sitting tight.

This is for companies traded in the UK.
",121643,"Share price is determined simply by supply and demand. Changes in the share price typically don't directly affect the company's operations, though there are some ways that it could (e.g. when the price is lower, stock compensation must include more shares to make up the difference).

Practically speaking, the share price for an active company never reaches 0. There are always people willing to buy at a low enough price. Furthermore, the price reported for a stock is the last price at which the stock was sold. If demand for the stock were to fall to 0, there would simply be no liquidity (no shares of the stock bought or sold), but the share price would still be reported at whatever the last transaction price was. The effect on shareholders would be that they would not be able to sell their stock (because there's no demand). They'd have to hold it until someone is willing to buy it.

121653,What would be the effect of closing stock market trading for two months to Coronavirus?,"We all hear about the massive fluctuations of the stock market due to fears and responses to the coronavirus pandemic. The market also has also triggered ""circuit breakers"" that temporarily halt trading to prevent massive swings. 

What could potentially happen if they just halted all trading for the next two months as a medium-term circuit breaker? Assume they did it at night without warning so that people couldn't get trades in before the closure. Would the rest of the economy continue to function otherwise (other coronavirus effects not withstanding)? During the closure, I would imagine that stock prices would just stay the same and then companies would adapt to their changing supply and demand situation as needed, right? 

Once it opened again there might be a swing once we know which companies have survived the pandemic and which won't but that speculation is happening on a daily basis now, why not just close it to prevent chaos and allow companies to think longer term without worrying about momentary market valuation?
",121668,"This idea of an extended ""market holiday"" is a completely normal idea.  A lot of people have had this idea, especially today, and I'll tell you below why it's terrible.  Just flat-out bad.  I once had this idea during the GFC when I was also new-ish to the market, so don't feel bad.  

I believe one of the CNBC hosts was touting this idea this morning.  A simple way to refute one of the underlying notions here is thus: If you don't like what you see then just go ahead and close your eyes, and the bad thing will go away right?  Of course not.

You might say ""Maybe the market just doesn't know what stocks are worth right now and that's why the market is down.""  I'd answer  that no one ever really knows exactly what a business/stock is worth (some exceptions aside).  Generally, people who sell think it's worth less than the price and people who buy think it's worth more, so why do we need to shut the market?  

You might say ""Maybe not everyone feels comfortable trading or feels like they know what this specific business/stock is worth right now so that's why we should halt trading.""  I'd answer with why can't the people that do want to trade continue trading and if you don't know/ just aren't ""comfortable"" then step aside, no one is forced to trade (unless maybe they used leverage/need the money).  

The punchline on extended market holidays, reiterated: Except in cases of traders or technology used to trade actually being unavailable/overtaxed for some reason, it's something we should avoid at all costs.  There are lots of negatives, and I'm not aware of any positives outside of the corner cases mentioned above.

A surprise trading halt as you mentioned of an extended variety is one of the worst things that can be done to a market.  Imagine...


Surprise! That thing you owned that you thought was liquid and you could buy or sell on most days Monday-Friday, excepting holidays, actually isn't!  And if you need to raise money between now and the market re-opening, tough! 
When the market does re-open, going forward, everything in that market should be priced more cheaply in one respect, and that is to account for a new illiquidity premium that has been introduced to the market.  All else equal, if you could own the same stock on two exchanges and one had random extended trading halts while the other didn't, there should be a disparity in the pricing, albeit not massive, between the two.  I'd rather own the one that trades more frequently.  Illiquidity in an asset is not a good thing.  
Just because something isn't trading and its price stays the same doesn't mean its value is not changing, it just means that it's harder to estimate(no one can truly see it) that true value.  It's quite possible that when the market reopened some of the companies would be worthless.  See the bullet two down on the economy for more info here. 
It's harder for everyone to deal in securities that have random extended halts because of those halts, which hurts liquidity even further going forward.  Less liquidity is bad.
The rest of the economy would continue to function, but not as well as it would with the market open.  So many transactions happen in the market on a daily basis and while some of these are retail or professional investors trading in the market, many of these trades are transactions where one company is hedging their exposure to another company.  Or, just using the market to see a gauge of the health of their counterparty to determine if they're going to engage in a business transaction and if so at what level with what other terms.  Imagine one company is buying components from another.  Each will look at the markets to judge the health of the other in their negotiations.  Without functioning markets, that process gets more difficult and it is exponentially more difficult at times of stress when companies are worried about the health of other companies.  That is when it is most important for markets to be open.  If markets are not, distrust reigns and activity/deals between companies grind to a halt.  That harms the economy.
Closing the market doesn't allow companies to think longer term.  Closing the market causes everyone to speculate which companies are in credit trouble and won't be around.  Others seek to limit or avoid exposure to the firms that might be failing by cancelling orders and halting shipments. Just the rumor that someone is in trouble will cause others to stop dealing with that firm and then it really is over for the company in question.  If the market was open that didn't have to happen.
The ""chaos"" you describe is simply the process of price discovery in times of uncertain economic outlook.  The market is volatile, it is what it is.  Instead of wondering what companies are likely worth for the next two months we can let them trade and have a best estimate.  That's what the market is, an estimating machine for the value of businesses. 
Those values are very important to businesses as they do business with each other.  The stock market is not some pure speculation machine/ random number generator that pushes values around willy-nilly.    
Think of it this way: Maybe I don't like when prices change so we should just have stocks trade once a year, then everyone can really ""plan long term?""  That sounds ludicrous right?  It's the same idea.
The world is a scarier place, companies are making less, businesses are hurting, people are dying and stocks are worth less as a result.  Closing our eyes won't make the situation any better.  Restricting trade by closing the market would hurt the underlying economy.  Trade is generally a pretty good thing.

",Accepted,"The simple reason is that they don't need and can't use liquidity; they know when they expect their foreign currency denominated cashflows will fall (within a reasonable range of dates) so they buy futures with the intention of taking delivery at maturity. OK that's not entirely true because the futures normally deliver financially rather than as an FX trade but the maths shows that the outcome is equivalent.

One other key thing to consider is that the company wants to lock in the exchange rate in the future, at the time when the cashflow occurs, rather than the current exchange rate. It doesn't matter (much) whether that rate is better or worse than spot, it is the rate they need to make their exchange at.

So, what the companies are doing is hedging the exchange rate that their future cashflows will be exchanged at rather than hedging the exchange rate at the current time but there is another, linked, reason why they don't make the exchange at spot in the current period; they don't actually have the cash to do so right now. These future cashflows have not been realised yet so they literally don't have the cash to spare now to convert to or from a different currency to complete the trade that you are suggesting. They will only have the cash available at the date when the exchange needs to be done so how can they use that cash in the current period?

I'm still confused on put options when a company goes bankrupt : stocks


  Example:
  
  You own one $10 put option on SNAP
  
  If SNAP goes to $1, than you have the RIGHT to exercise your contract and buy 100 shares for $1 and sell it immediately for $10. If the stock price goes to $0 (in case of bankruptcy) you still have the RIGHT (and the person that sold you the option the OBLIGATION) to buy the shares for $0 so it can be sold for $10 a share.

A long put gives you the right to put the stock to someone else, meaning sell it at the strike price.

This all assumes that the markets are open for trading.

If the financial markets are shut down, I assume that contracts will still be exercisable during a shut down and even if not, the OCC exercises all options at expiration if they are one cent ITM which I also assume would still be done. There might be an issue with ability to sell the stock. 
",Accepted,"It's because investment accounts are legally required to be separate from deposit accounts, and the bank must manage them separately as well.

Deposit accounts (i.e checking and savings) are only for cash and cash equivalents. The money you put into a deposit account is (in spirit) merely being held by your bank for safety and convenience purposes, and they must give it back to you any time you ask for it. Therefore, banks are legally limited in what they can do with it while you're entrusting it to them. Yes, the bank does lend that money to other depositors, putting it at some risk, but they are heavily regulated on how they do that. Ideally, since you can never lose your deposit, the bank isn't allowed to lose it either. Deposit accounts are guaranteed (up to $250,000) by the FDIC, which has regulatory power over commercial deposit banks and can preemptively shut down or otherwise intervene to ensure banks can make good on their deposits.

Investment (brokerage) accounts, on the other hand, are for the purpose of purchasing (possibly risky) investments that can potentially lose money. Any investments you make, you're on your own. The bank is only required to prohibit you from doing a few specific things thay are very risky and/or stupid. The ""cash"" portion of your investment account is money that the bank can use to purchase it's own (possibly risky) investments. Although they have a fiduciary requirement to protect your money, this is not the same thing as a guarantee. Investment banks are insured by the SIPC, but unlike the FDIC, it has no regulatory power and does not insure the actual value of your investments.

In short, banks have much more flexibility with investment money than they do with deposit money. This is why you have to do a transfer before you can invest.

The reason things are this way is because of some very shady activities that banks were engaging in during the Great Depression, and during the subprime mortgage crisis.

  On March 16, 2020, amid an economic crisis caused by the 2020
  coronavirus pandemic, for the first time since the inception of the
  Federal Reserve, the fractional reserve requirement was reduced to
  0%.[11]


Now question is why would banks not approve a loan? Worst case they get 0 $ back, but that does not mean that they lost money since credit was created out of thin air so even if every credit defaults they still will not loose any money and anything they get back is pure profit.

note:for simplification this assumes that cost of processing a loan is 0% for bank, we know that realistically they need to pay their employees.
",121772,"
  Worst case they get 0 $ back, but that does not mean that they lost money since credit was created out of thin air so even if every credit defaults they still will not loose any money and anything they get back is pure profit.


Obviously if a bank never lost money by not getting paid back they would make loans all day long, even ones they knew they would not get paid back on.

But the fact of the matter is, a bank's profits are based on how much they actually make on the loan beyond the cost of the loan itself.  The cost of the loan includes the principle which must be paid back.   What you refer to as being created ""out of thin air"" doesn't mean that money is being created from nothing, it is referring to the fact that the same money can be loaned out multiple times, effectively creating what appears to be actual money several times in excess of the actual amount of money floating around.

Another way of looking at it is that a bank generally isn't lending its own money.  They get the money from other sources and lend it out at higher rates than they pay, and from the excess the pay their expenses and hopefully have some profits left over.  So if you put $100 in an account at the bank, the bank can lend that $100 out and earn interest on the money, but at the end of the day, they still owe you $100 on demand whenever you ask for it.  The ""created out of thin air"" comes from the fact that the person who lends the money will need to put the money somewhere, most likely either the same or a different bank, or if they use the money to pay somebody else, that person most likely will deposit the same money in the bank, so ultimately, most of the money they lend out stays in the banking system where it can be lent out again.

The fractional reserve requirement just states how much of that money can be lent out again in the aggregate.  A 0% reserve requirement basically means the bank can lend it all out again.  It doesn't mean that they will be able to (only so much money in loans is being sought at any given time) nor does it reduce the fiduciary requirements to make good loans that are likely to get paid back.

121820,Calculations Check on $SPY Strangle,"I'm researching options strategies and I started paper trading a $SPY options. Here's my strategy:

Set up a strangle 5% above and below the market price expiring a month from the day of trade. 12 contracts total. 

On Feb 20th, I looked at the cost of that setup:

Actual price of the stock ($SPY) = $336.40
Sell a Call 5% above the market (SPY200320C00355000) = $0.13 x 100 x 12 = + $156.00
Sell a Put 5% below the market (SPY200320P00319000) = $1.42 x 100 x 12 = + $1,704.00
So on Feb 20th, I would have received $1,860.00 for selling those options.


A month later, the idea is that one of those options would be worthless and the other one cheaper than the price paid (of course this was not the case with the current market/Covid-19)

On Mar 20th, I would have to pay back

Current price of the stock ($SPY) = $244.41
SPY200320C00355000 is now worth $0.01 = $12
SPY200320P00319000 is now worth $77.10 = $92,520.00


leaving me with a total of $ -90,660.00

Although it is clear that this strategy backfired given the current situation, I would like to understand if my calculations are right. 

More specifically, do I have to consider the fact that for every point that an index option goes beyond the strike, I will have to pay/earn $100? If this is the case, I would have to pay an additional 9,200 per contract (?), or $110,400

Since starting, I learned that an Iron Condor is much more secure than a Strangle and I'm planning to paper trade that strategy for a while.
",121822,"I think there's a few things you may be misunderstanding about selling a strangle. 

First: 


  A month later, the idea is that one of those options would be worthless and the other one cheaper than the price paid (of course this was not the case with the current market/Covid-19)


The ideal scenario behind selling a strangle is that both options expire OTM, as they were OTM when you sold them to begin with (in your example, on February 20th). This would result in you keeping all of the premium you initially received, the $1860.00 (not including commissions associated w/ selling these options, which can vary depending on your account, but we'll assume no commissions for the sake of the theoretical scenario). 

Second part: 


  More specifically, do I have to consider the fact that for every point that an index option goes beyond the strike, I will have to pay/earn $100? If this is the case, I would have to pay an additional 9,200 per contract (?), or $110,400


One, SPY isn't an index and if you wanted to sell options on an index, you could simply sell them on $SPX. Two, I think you're neglecting the fact that movements in the underlying are not the only factor that affects the value of an option, you also have time, and volatility (in a simplified sense) that affect the value of the option you sold. So you can't simply just use this rule of thumb without taking these into account, unless you're saying you are only concerned with what the price the option is on the day of expiration. In this scenario, then yes you'd be only concerned with the difference between the underlying, and the strike price of your option. 

So regarding the 319 Put that was sold at $1.42 a contract, then on the day of expiration (March 20th) this put would be worth $74.59 a contract, and in your example, this could either get exercised against you (if you let it) and in that case, you'd have to buy 100 * 12 = 1200 shares of SPY at $319.00 which would cost: 

$319.00 * 1200 = $382,800 and then your position is actually currently worth $244.41 * 1200 = $293,292 so your loss would be: 

$(293,292 - 382,800) + $1860 = $-87,648 (recall the $1860 in premium you received initially)

Or more commonly, you would have to buy back the option to close out the contract (since you sold to open the contract), which would cost: $74.59 * 100 * 12 = $89,508. Note that the call would expire OTM (worthless) and you don't have to buy it back. But, recall that you initially received $1,860.00 in premium when you sold these two contracts, so your total loss is: $87,648.

It's sort of like asking if stocks are going to go up or down.  I'll list here the three big things that will determine the value of the USD in the medium term.  There are many others but I believe these to be the big ones.

(1) The decrease in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus should be strongly deflationary.  This can increase the amount of stuff that a dollar can buy because there isn't as much demand for the stuff.  So effectively the dollar strengthens.

(2) A flight to safety during time of stress where the USD is generally considered the safest currency.  The dollar has generally been strengthening against other currencies.  Part of this strengthening has been related though to the fact that a lot of borrowing happens in USD and when you borrow USD and then lose money you have to pay back the USD that you lost.  This has meant dollar buying, which has certainly contributed to the recent dollar strength.

(3) Stimulus/relief efforts on the part of the federal gov't to counteract the economic effects of the virus mean more debt to GDP.  Giving people money to spend like this in inflationary, which should reduce the value of the dollar.  The more debt you have relative to your ability to pay, then the more those lending to you should theoretically charge you in interest because you are a riskier borrower and less likely to make good on all of your payments. 

So we have two deflationary effects and one large inflationary effect.  The depth and length of the crisis will determine how much dollar ""strength""* we see from #1 and #2, and the gov't response to the depth and breadth of the crisis will determine #3.  They're intertwined.

122034,Deciding on a correct down payment for a house,"I am in the process of making an offer for a house. Wife and I have about 135K saved, with steady jobs, both happen to be an 'essential business' as required for this period during the corona virus.

Initially, I wanted to put 20% down (about 74K) to avoid PMI and have lower monthly payments.

I have since reversed course on this. I think 10% (about 37K) is better, and here is my reasoning. PMI calculators online suggest the PMI will be about 150 a month. 37K invested returns should be more than double the yearly PMI payments during an average year. We plan on being in this house for the foreseeable future, so I am playing the long game with this chunk of investment. We can also have the option to make a chunk payment in the future to bring it to 20% equity and get the PMI taken off if we choose. Also, this gives us access to this cash in a more liquid form during these unsure times.

Does this reasoning make sense? With a long term outlook, would it still be wise to sink the extra 37K into the house and get rid of the PMI?
",122037,"Short answer: 
It probably makes sense to avoid the PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance), but it ultimately depends on how probable it is that you are unable to pay the monthly installments with/without the extra savings. 

Long answer:
While i am not an expert on the specifics of the US mortgage market (I presume the question pertains to US), it seems that a PMI (or an increment of the overall interest rate charged on the loan) varies between 0.5% and 2% p.a. and is charged on the overall loan amount (90% in this case). Your loan amount works out to 333k from the provided information and your annual PMI payment to 1800. This puts it on the lower end with 0.54%. 

That means that with the 37k you plan to invest instead of paying down, you have to earn 4.9% p.a. plus the normal mortgage interest rate on those 37k - all this net of tax (assuming you get no tax deduction on your mortgage/PMI payments). This seems like a tall order compared to a ""risk-free"" savings you realize by having a lower mortgage interest rate on the overall loan amount without the PMI. So based on risk/return considerations alone, you are probably better off avoiding the PMI. Only a very low PMI rate would result a different outcome from that perspective.

Another consideration to make is whether putting the 37k aside instead of using them for a down payment would improve your worst-case scenario and could buy you additional time in case you have difficulties repaying the mortgage. Only you can figure out how much this ""option"" is worth, considering how secure your and your spouse's incomes are, what are you going to do with the 61k that remain even if you choose to pay down  and how much the monthly mortgage repayment is, compared to your income. Based on the information you provided, it seems that the 61k can last you for a significant period of mortgage repayments, so that the value of any additional cushion is probably very small.

Are you confident the letter actually came from the dealership? Does the letter ask you to send a check to the correct dealership address, payable to the dealership, with all other contact info matching the dealership?

",123485,"Market reactions to information are not always timely, proportional, or rational. 

We don't know the full impact of our current situation; we're feeling it out.


Some people (bulls), believe that the initial dip was an over-reaction, that the government response will prevent further decline, and/or that things will go back to normal pretty quickly, so they are buying the dip.
On the other side you have people (bears) that believe the initial reaction was just a start but not enough to price-in the full impact, that the government can't prop up the economy, and/or that this will drag on for a long while, so they are betting on further decline. 


The problem with this idea of information being priced-in is that we all know there's a global pandemic, but there are very different opinions about how much that should affect the market.

Consider unemployment levels: We have projections about unemployment rate potentially hitting a peak over 30%. Meanwhile, the current unemployment rate is 4.4% and projected to hit double digits in April. The only way all of that information could be appropriately priced in is if everyone agreed about the reasonableness of the projections and had the economic prowess to understand the actual impact of those figures.

Instead, what happens is that some people will see the actual April unemployment numbers as surprising new information to react to, while others will see it as old information in line with their expectations. Add in thousands of other pieces of information about which people have conflicting opinions, and it becomes pretty much impossible to know in advance if that information was all priced in appropriately.

The most recent comparable event is the subprime mortgage crash. Many people thought bottom was hit around November 2008 and there was a brief counter-trend rally before actual bottom was hit around March 2009. We don't know at this time if the market has bottomed out yet or not; nor do we know how long recovery could take.

I've got an automatic contribution for my health savings account. The balance grows and grows. We've barely had a chance to spend any of it, aside from dental expenses.

Are there guidelines about how much one should aim to set aside for medical expenses? Are there actuarial figures about what medical expenses are likely to be, over a given period? (Obviously any of us could come down with a horrible chronic disease at any time, and drain the account. The ultimate decision will be balancing risk and opportunity cost, but as it stands I don't have any information about the risk.)
",123514,"There are few different things to consider:


Deductible : Since you have an HSA you are probably on a High Deductible insurance plan. Take a look at your HSA balance and divide by your max out of pocket deductible. That's the number of years you are covered for the ""worst case"" scenario. I'd say you want at least ten, but 100 years would be excessive. Depends of course on you own risk comfort.
Retirement : health care cost will likely be the single largest expense in retirement and unfortunately it's the hardest to predict and find good data on. A recent fidelity study put the average life time out-of-pocket cost for a couple into the $300.000 range. Other studies quote about $5000-$7000 in today's dollar per year per person on Medicare. Health Care inflation is currently significantly higher than regular inflation, which complicates the math further. Still, it's not unreasonable to have several hundred thousand dollars squirreled away for retirement health care
Coronavirus and shifts in the Health Care system: This is pure speculation at this point, but chances are that the current crisis will have an impact on the way Health Care works and gets paid for in the future. The most drastic change would be a single payer system (as many other countries in the civilized world already have) but it's very hard to predict how an HSA would roll over into this. One of the more plausible scenarios would be to allow a roll over into an IRA but that's all a wild guess at the moment. 
In any case the current system is stretched thin already. The average retiree  spends more than  40% of their social security income on health care and it is getting worse quickly.
Investment: HSA contributions are pre-tax money. In most cases that alone will outweigh any potential investment return. Assuming there is no high interest debt, I would recommend to first max out pre-tax retirement contributions, then pre-tax college savings and then pre-tax HSA. If you have other highly attractive investment vehicle you can consider those too. Stocks are cheap at the moment, although very risky and likely to be volatile for a while.


Looking at the actual medical risk is probably not that helpful. Statistics don't really help if it's just you and your family. Would you be doing anything differently if you knew the risk for a major health disaster is 0.1% instead of 0.2 % ?

If you do choose to make a lump sum payment on the car loan, it probably makes sense to actively communicate with your bank to make sure the payment is applied immediately to principal.

About me:

I'm in my 30s, living in the US. I don't own any property. I'm currently making below the poverty line, but I'm getting by. I have no debt. I have $2K in a savings account. I may be moving across the country for graduate school in a little over a year.

The return on investment for CDs is abysmal.  They're only a good choice if you need absolute certainty that your investment won't lose value (or, won't lose value too quickly after adjusting for inflation).
Real estate is risky, particularly on the small scale.  A single stroke of bad luck can wipe out your entire investment.
The stock market is also risky, but unlike with real estate, you've got enough money to mitigate that risk by spreading your investment (eg. with a mutual fund, an index fund, or simply buying a wide variety of stocks).  Expect your investment to lose value in the near future -- the market is way down, but I don't think it's quite hit bottom yet, and long-term fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic will keep things unsettled for a year or more.

A high stock price can make the company look prestigious. E.g. A company trading at $1,000 per share will be perceived as more valuable even though the firm's market capitalization may be the same as a company whose shares trade at $50.
Share values mustn't fall too low! There have been cases where companies have split shares only to see the stock market dive, pushing shares below $10. Psychologically, this may turn off some shareholders, and in extreme cases, share prices may be too low for a company to be listed on an exchange. Companies will avoid splitting to protect themselves from this possibility. Doubtless large caps wouldn't fancy themselves dropping to being a penny stock!

  Why don't they reverse stock split to uplift their share prices?


Stock splits (and reverse-splits) are a zero-sum activity (minus what costs there are to actually implement the split). It's like trading 10 dimes for a dollar bill. The company is not worth any more or less after the fact. It used to be that a lower share price was desired since it would enable more investors that had to buy shares in 100-share lots. Nowadays, with index funds dominating the market, that benefit has largely gone away, which is why you see companies like Amazon and Apple decide not to split their shares that are worth hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. 

A reverse split may be required in order to stay listed on exchanges, but it often seen as a large negative signal, much like suspending a dividend. 

So companies have no financial incentive to split or reverse split, but often have behavioral incentives not to reverse split.
",Reasonable,"Maybe you are thinking of a buy-back?

It is another way to reduce the number of issued shares.

If a company has enough cash on hand, the company buys its shares back (but only from those who are wanting to sell).

If the share prices had fallen much below the book value, the company can actually increase the value of the remaining shares (and thus potentially the price)

Just by being a willing buyer it can prevent the share price from falling so far below the book value that it would be attractive to asset strippers.

The book value is pretty much the net asset value divided by the number of shares

A few weeks ago, I had a verbal offer accepted on a house (I am a first time buyer). I had initially offered a bit lower than the asking price, that offer was rejected, and I ended up offering the asking price- and asking the sellers to include some fixtures &amp; furnishings. This offer was accepted.

Since then, the coronavirus has broken out in the UK, and the markets have all dropped considerably (I was intending to put money saved in a Lifetime ISA toward the deposit- so this has obviously lost considerable value). Most things I've read are saying that we have no idea how long term the impact of the coronavirus will be on the financial markets, or whether it will impact the housing market in terms of house prices. Mortgage rates are already very low, so are unlikely to get any lower, particularly now that the Bank of England base rate has been dropped to 0.1%.

I'm unsure what to do regarding the offer I have put in on the house. I am not buying for any reason other than owning my own home, and to establish that for myself and my family. I am fortunate that my job is relatively secure- even if there were to be a recession, and even if I were to lose my job, I have a trade to fall back on which is still in a growth industry in the UK. My experience to date has been that it generally takes me between 1-2 months to apply, interview for &amp; receive an offer for a job.

So, given that I am not looking at the house for any reason other than to establish a home (i.e. it is not primarily a financial investment), should I contact the vendors to reduce my offer, given all the uncertainty going on at the moment?

Wealth groups really depends. I mean, your income is nice - but if you get wealthy you start getting income for example from rental. Which sort of does offset the need for emergency funds. Depending on where your wealth is, you may also have a lot of liquidity just somewhere around - not only for emergencies, but also because you want cash in case of a surprise chance to make money. There really is no good answer. None which is not too private or too showing offy.

Generally once you have your reserves, start building savings for whatever (retirement comes in). That may include buying YOUR house (or not, some people need mobility more than THOSE savings), but definitely putting money into stocks, real estate that generates income. Depending on your passive income you may replace your personal emergency funds with repair funds-  I can live, for example, from my rental income, albeit on a reduced level. But it means I do not really need 6 months living expenses. OTOH sometimes you need repairs/renovations, so there is a property emergency funds. And yes, those do not wait - becuase we talk of rental property. If something needs fixing, it needs fixing.

If you approach retirement or a financially oriented lifestyle, you likely want 3-5 years reserves on the bank. Stock market crashes can be nasty and you don't want to take money out. OTOH if your financial lifestyle is trading.... well. Depends on your career planning.

Common advice given is that if you decide to become an active or passive investor, you should stick with the choice you've made.


No you shouldn't. It is perfectly fine to supplement an active portfolio by passive index funds, or to supplement an index fund portfolio with several carefully chosen stocks.

What is bad advice is to buy lots of various active funds (leading to index returns, because there are so many of the active funds, without low costs of index investing). If you believe in active investing, you should select only a fund or at most two in the same market, having fund managers you can trust.

What is also bad advice is to buy quasi-active funds, funds that claim to be active but don't really take any active risk because the fund manager fears losing to the index return. In this case, too, you pay for active management but get passive returns.

Let me propose a case where you could supplement an index portfolio with some actively chosen stocks. If you, for example, like traveling a lot more than most people. Unfortunately, traveling uses oil, so it might be a good idea to buy stocks of oil companies. Traveling also requires aeroplanes, so it might be a good idea to buy aeroplane manufacturer stocks. You of course travel with an airline, so it might be a good idea to buy airliner stocks.

Or, if you drive a lot with an electric car. In this case, it might be a good idea to supplement your index portfolio with stocks of Tesla and electric utility companies, especially those that produce electricity with fixed cost structure like hydropower or nuclear power.

Let me also propose a case where you could supplement an active portfolio with some index funds: you run out of ideas. Simply said. You have so much money to invest but you can't find any companies where you would like to increase your ownership. In this case, it's perfectly fine to buy index funds. Or, you could hire a monkey to throw darts into a list of stocks to select new investments for you. But it's much simpler to buy index funds than to hire a dart-throwing monkey.

Risk is a tradeoff. A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) reduces risk but also reduces expected return. Since the market moves up more often than it moves down, statistically you're more likely to be better off investing the lump sum and letting it grow over time. 

Being better off investing regular amounts over time when you have a lump sum ready to invest would be a result of luck, not skill (unless you know something that the market doesn't already know).

There is also no need to open a new factory, because our market research team has determined that no one will buy the new spoons from the new factory.

So, what does the company do with the cash? It could (1) sit on it, and earn basically nothing. Or it could (2) invest it in something completely unrelated to the spoon business. Or, it could (3) send it back to the shareholders. Let's look at each option:

(1) If the company just keeps the cash in the bank account, then it will earn basically no interest, and the investors who own shares in the corporation will be unhappy to get such little returns on corporate assets. If they wanted to have a low-risk cash portfolio, they would do that with their own money, they wouldn't want their spoon-making-investment to make that decision for them.

Buying a fork-making factory could lead to trouble - why what if our spoon scientists forget to make the tines, and just makes the whole thing rounded, based on what worked for them in spoon making?? Again, if a company steps outside of its area of expertise, it is deciding, on behalf of its shareholders, to diversify its portfolio.

Note that some companies do successfully diversify, but it is typically part of an overarching plan that makes sense together, or else it often fails.

(3) If the company returns the cash to the shareholders they can decide for themselves what to do with the cash. Some will invest in low-risk things like government bonds or simple savings accounts earning minimal interest. Some will invest in competing spoon-makers, and some might invest in new fork-making ventures. But the decision on how to invest goes back to the individual shareholders.

Buying back stock is just one way to get money back to shareholders. The other common way would be to pay out a dividend. In financial theory, there are basically 3 differences between a share buy-back and a dividend: (A) A buyback is optional, meaning only the shareholders looking to sell their shares, will have shares bought by the company; (B) A buyback happens relative to the current share price in the market, meaning that part of the decision to make a buyback could be based on whether the company believes itself to be undervalued; and (C) the tax implications are different [In general, most countries tax capital gains on selling your shares, at a lower rate than corporate dividends].

So, why would a bank do a share buyback right now? Probably because interest rates are at a historic low, meaning that the bank has a limited ability to invest its capital to earn what it feels are good returns. So instead, it is leaving the choice to its shareholders how to invest - and because the bank probably feels its shares are undervalued, it is preferential to do this instead of paying a dividend. For the shareholders who remain in the company, the increase in share price is an indication that the decision made by the bank was one that benefited them.

Quick note on the political aspect hinted at here: The main reason it is contentious to do a share buy-back in times like this, is that a government could give a stimulus package to a business, with the goal of having that business invest in itself, hire workers, etc.; if instead of investing in itself it just pays out the cash to shareholders, the government has effectively 'bailed out' the relatively wealthy individuals who own shares, rather than the working class who they were attempting to get jobs for.
",Reasonable,"Because they have money and stocks are cheap. The more company own itself the less it have to share profit with others.
Having less dividend to pay out means more profit for the bank in the coming years.

122075,Better way to invest for a short time for a period of one year,"I am having a rather confusing financial situation. A the moment, I am having around 1200 euros a month on savings. I have the emergency fund already set up. The only huge debt i have that i need to take care off is my car which I am planning to pay it off in july next year. CoVid19 situation does not hinder my job as its deemed necessary by my company and hence I will be having a steady cash flow. 

I am looking for a better investment scenario , as I would like to invest this money but would need to cash out the next year to pay the debt off for car. It is possible for me to risk the loss upto 20% of my total investment. I normally follow a value investment strategy and long term holding. I am also interested in REITs but in general in order to cash out from REIT, one must do that an year advance to liquidate and hence i believe this does not suit my situation.  So none of the strategies that I know are helpful here. Is there any specific investment that i can make during this year which gives me flexibility to invest my money ? 

I am not really satisfied in leaving the money in the bank account doing nothing as I live in Germany and the interest on savings accounts are  as low as zero and is not much helpful.
",122079,"If you can lose 20% and still make the balloon  payment then only risk the 20%. Based on your question you can set aside 1,200 a month for the next 15 months. Since 20% of 15 months is 3 months take the next three months payments and invest it in a ETF or mutual fund. The remaining 12 months keep it safe in a bank or CD.

You can do this because you already have an emergency fund, and you believe your job is secure. If you didn't have the emergency fund you would send the extra amount there. If you were worried about your job you wouldn't want to tie up money you might need soon. 

Of course if you can save interest by making the balloon payment early, I would wait until the last 3 months to invest, and make the balloon payment as soon as possible or even make a larger monthly payment.
",Reasonable,"Banks are businesses, with the attendant differences in service offerings and internal cost structures. This alone accounts for differences in prices for essentially identical goods and services. After all, every accountant offers accounting services by definition, but not all of them charge the same amount.

Googling about for the bank LBC Digital at the top of your list, it turns out that this is Laurentian Bank (cool name, if I may say so, but no, it's not mine). According to a November 2019 review by Money We Have:


  The best high interest savings accounts in Canada just got a new player as Laurentian Bank has just launched LBC Digital, an online bank that helps Canadians improve their financial health.


Online banks, like online shops, can have lower cost structures compared to their bricks-and-mortar peers. They may have fewer staff, less rental, and so on. If so, every dollar of profit after expenses needs somewhat less revenue support than peers with higher costs.

When new entrants compete against incumbents, pricing is a popular mechanism with which to get customers. By giving more interest for an equivalent product, they'd probably hope that more people would choose to keep their money with them instead with other banks. More established players have other levers to pull. For example, if you've been getting exceptional service from one bank, you might be happy to forego some interest to continue getting that service. This might be monetary, such as low mortgage costs, or non-monetary, such as simpler access to credit approvals. Or you might just like to be able to walk in and have staff recognise you on sight because you've been banking at that branch for years.

The actual reasons aren't likely to be published, but there are enough other factors that equal insurance (e.g. CDIC) doesn't translate automatically to equal rates.

122122,"How, or should I repay debt during Covid-19 crisis?","During Covid19 pandemic I managed to save some money and I was thinking about repaying some of my debts, however, I'm not sure should I do it, or keep cash just in case things turn for the worse. This is my situation with concerns against repaying each debt.

I have roughly 7000 GBP

I have three debts:


6500 GBP overdraft (APR 35%)  
2500 GBP PayPal credit (APR 19.9%) 
1600 GBP Amex credit card (APR 23.5%)


I could repay my overdraft, it would save me around 150 GBP each month and I could still use it as if money would be in my bank account in case of a real emergency.

I could repay both PayPal and Amex cards saving around 120 GBP each month and have some money left. My concern is that PayPal Credit and Amex are the least acceptable forms of payment in the UK and in case I would need access to money there is a chance I won't be able to use.

I can just keep the cash and pay interest on all three accounts until crisis is over.

What should i do?
",122124,"Keeping some liquid cash is sensible, but the exorbitant rates on your debt will hurt you long-term. Pay them off as quickly as safely possible.

Since you have high-interest debt, getting rid of that debt is more important than maintaining a large emergency fund. Having both savings and overdraft fees is illogical. However, I understand that you'd rather have cash than paying of other debts if you expect to be laid off soon.

To save the most money, the optimal solution is to pay off the highest-interest debt first. Here, that is the overdraft.

Unless you will also be able to pay off the other debts within a couple of months, it could be sensible to refinance. A small loan for £5000 at 6% over 12 months (~ £440/month) could give you breathing room to pay off all high-interest debts and stabilize your finances – if you are still eligible for such loans.

Aside from affecting job stability, the Covid-19 situation doesn't change a lot. If you've struggled to live without debt pre-Corona, it won't get easier now. That's why it could be helpful to pay off as much as possible now, so that you aren't saddled with endless interest payments in more difficult times: who knows how long this crisis will last? And you need to figure out why you have so much cash and so much debt, but that is out of scope here.
",Reasonable,"Bear in mind that the credit score is generated by some secret formula that will never be disclosed to you.  Attempting to game it is rarely worth the effort, especially if you end up paying excessive amounts of interest in doing so.

The purpose of a credit score is simply to answer the question ""if this person borrows money from us, how likely are they to pay it back on time?""

So the most important thing you should do is make payments on time.


  I wasn't sure what to title this question. I am new to building my
  credit score and using credit cards. I am hoping to clear up a few
  questions I have. One is, if I purchase something on my credit card
  and setup minimum monthly payments does that negatively affect my
  credit score? If so, and if I setup payments that are higher than that
  minimum monthly payment but less than paying in full every month does
  that affect my credit score less than just making minimum payments?


If you pay the card off in full every month, that shows you pay your debts and have no money problems.  That's good.

Paying only the minimum can lead to ever-increasing debt if you continue spending on the card.  Not only is that bad for you, as you are paying excessive amounts of interest every month, but if the debt gets too close to the credit limit, then it looks like you have money problems.  That's bad.


  Are there any cards that will allow me to disburse a debt over a
  period of time (with interest) without affecting my credit score? For
  instance, lets say I want to purchase a $300 item from a store which
  does not have a monthly payment feature to break that up; say for
  instance, into 3 $100 payments over 3 months. Are there any credit
  cards that will do that for me without it negatively impacting my
  credit score?


That would be any credit card.  You can pay off as much as you like any month, so long as it's at least the minimum amount.  If you want to pay off a third of the debt every month, that's fine.

So the comparison is between an S&amp;P500 fund (I used SPY) and a bond fund of average maturity around 10 years (I used IEF). Here's a link comparing performance during the crisis.

Regarding what performs better than a 10-ish year treasury bond during a crisis, I'd say a longer treasury bond. There are maturities up to 30 years, and they did better during 2008 than shorter maturity bonds. However, those bonds expose you to significantly more fluctuations because of interest rate changes, so I'd avoid them unless you understand their risks.

  Chances are everyone who reads this StackExchange knows that debt is dangerous and should be avoided.


While I do agree that debt is dangerous and should be avoided, not everyone does.  Heck there are people on here that advocate taking pay day loans!  

Even the most debt adverse financial commentators suggest that a mortgage is an acceptable risk.  They may only advocate certain structures of mortgages, but they see it as a way for most families to build wealth.

Less debt adverse might suggest a well structured business loan in order to earn more money.  The business might be rental real estate properties or owning a franchise. Theoretically the difference between the finance charge and return on investment is great and they can earn money on the arbitrage.  

This is how, in my opinion, Altria sees this transaction.  Either the loss to their future profitability was perceived to be so great, or that they could make so much money off of the acquisition that it was worth financing that transaction.

Companies do this all the time.  For example, Darden will open new restaurants while they are holding debt and paying a dividend.  There are countless other examples.

The dividend is seen as a very different matter.  Many companies pay a dividend, despite its tax inefficiency, because it increase confidence in the company.  They may even see it as a commitment to long term employees, that are now retired, that acquired the stock over many years of payroll deduction.  They even get a lot of free marketing from paying a constant or even increasing dividend.  Dividends tend to be a very sacred thing and the hallmark of a ""blue chip"" stock.

The market I'm currently in was extremely competitive, houses were all generally going for significantly more than their asking price, as mine did.

I have nearly everything ready - loan arranged, survey of the house completed, solicitor ready to sign everything.

Now with Covid, a recession is more than likely coming our way.

Furthermore, with lock-downs in place - the seller is extremely unlikely to find an alternative buyer in the near future (it's an executor sale if that makes any difference).

I was thinking of trying to put some pressure onto the seller to lower the agreed price.

While I don't want to lose the house (and the money we have spent so far on legal etc.), I would also like to take advantage of potentially lower mortgage repayments.

Is it a bad idea to put this to the estate agent and be forthright about exactly why I'm asking to lower the price? Is there a ""reasonable"" amount to lower the purchase price by?

Edit

My intention here isn't to ""screw"" the seller as several commentators assume that I am trying to do.

At the end of the day, I'm a first time buyer who has effectively agreed to buy a house at ""peak"" economic health. Within a couple of weeks of this agreement, economic impacts of covid-19 were already being felt and the short / medium term prospects are not good.

At the end of this year, if covid hasn't wreaked enough havoc, there is a very real risk that Brexit could have an extremely negative impact on my country.

So while the honorable thing to do might be to commit to the agreed purchase price, this might be an extremely unwise decision from a personal finance point of view.

""Why don't you just pull out of the sale then?"" 

I could do that, that leaves the seller in a very bad position as well - it will be extremely unlikely they will be able to find another buyer in the short / medium term - so giving them an opportunity to consider my concerns might be better than simply walking away.

How much do you have in an ""emergency fund""? If you have enough cash on hand to handle most true emergencies (maybe a few thousand dollars in case your A/C goes out or your car loses its transmission), then put everything else towards the debt. If you have a huge emergency fund but are paying interest on debt, then that money is costing you in interest payments.
Why do you have debt in the first place? If you use this one-time income to pay down credit card debt but don't solve the underlying spending problem, then you'll just be back where you started at some point. Make sure you spend less than you make (ideally by not using credit cards at all) and get a grip on your budget, or your efforts will be in vain.


Remember that you ""earn"" money by paying off debt equal to the interest rate that you pay off.  For example, if the annual interest rate on your debt is 10% and you pay $1,000 to it, you ""earn"" a roughly 10% annual return on that $1,000 by saving you $100 in interest over a year (plus a small amount due to compounding).

As a result, television ratings have now become the driving force behind sports, even bigger than actually bringing fans to the games.&nbsp;&nbsp;source: Why TV ratings in sports are more important than attendance - Nov 17, 2015

According to rickandmorty.fandom


  In Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat, the purpose of Operation Phoenix was revealed. When Rick dies in any dimension, his mind is automatically uploaded into a clone body.


Due to differences in realities / dimensions, it's possible that the Phoenix Protocol is deactivated for good in some of them.

Since the experiment started during the Big Trouble in Little Sanchez episode (season 2 episode 7) it's possible that deaths were final before that. For example, in Rick Potion #9 (season 1 episode 6) 


  Just as Rick twists the screw the third time, the device violently explodes, instantly (and messily) killing Rick and Morty. 


So those are dead-dead, real dead. Later, another Rick first tells Morty about the infinite realities, and 


  Rick further explains the he just had to find one of those realities in which they died soon afterwards so that they could come in and take their place.

13437,When is coronavirus leading to FIP contagious?,"I adopted two middle-aged (or older?) cats from the same shelter 3.5 years ago.  Both were healthy until recently when one developed FIP.  Since I adopted them they have had no contact with other cats, aside from whatever happens behind the scenes at the vet's office.

According to this article from the Cornell Veterinary School, a cat can be exposed to the virus (with no symptoms) and develop FIP years later.  So it sounds like it's possible that my cat came to me already infected and the disease only manifested now.  (It's also possible that the other cat is a carrier who transmitted it to him without getting sick himself.)

When is a cat with future-FIP infectious?  Only during an initial exposure to coronavirus (when my cat caught this), or from that time onward?  Only after developing FIP?  If a cat has been exposed to coronavirus in the past but has never shown symptoms of FIP, can he transmit that coronavirus to other cats?

I am trying to figure out the effect of this on my remaining cat, and whether I can safely adopt another cat to join him.  There is no reliable test for FIP other than biopsies, so at best testing can tell us if he's been exposed to coronavirus (the test looks for the antibodies). But my biggest concern is whether he could be infectious.  (If he's also infected then, sadly, there's nothing we can do about that.  We can only test for coronavirus and coronavirus doesn't always lead to FIP from what I've read.)
",15931,"Veterinary partner is a very reliable website that should be able to answer your questions on FIP

Your cat wont get FIP by being with an FIP + cat, it can however contract coronavirus. And yes as you mentioned, not all coronavirus cats will develop FIP.

From my ""Common Diseases of Companion Animals"" textbook:


  80% to 90% of cats in catteries have antibodies to FECV and these cats shed virus intermittently.


That being said by continuously disinfecting and only having one/two cat(s) in your home you can eventually clear out FECV (most common household disinfectants work).

You can check your current cat what his current anti-body levels are for coronavirus if you're concerned about a new cat coming in as well.

An excerpt from veterinary partner on FECV:


  An active infection lasts several weeks to a few months. Virus is shed in the infected cat’s stool during this period. If the cat is reinfected, virus sheds again for weeks to months. During this time, the cat may or may not seems at all ill. Some infected cats do not shed virus.
  
  The mutation to a form of virus that can cause FIP is more likely to occur in an immune-compromised cat. Most cats with FIP are less than one year old (their immaturity is their immune compromise). Crowding is also an important source of immune-compromise. Another important factor in mutation is multiple exposure/infections. When cats keep getting reinfected, the virus they carry has more chance of mutating to a form that causes FIP.


I've only seen 3 cases of FIP in almost 4 years in practice, it's not very common.

27391,How to take care of dog's toiletry needs if dog walking is banned?,"Most countries seem to allow dog walking during anti-COVID-19 measures preventing the spread of the coronavirus. However, there's at least South Africa where even dog walking is disallowed. The extent to which it's disallowed is a bit unclear, but the wording from the news suggest that dog owners are supposed to not get out of their houses unless they ""really want to"":


  Dog lovers in South Africa have been ordered not to take their beloved pets for a walk for three weeks, Police Minister Bheki Cele said at a news conference.
  
  “We had discussions and agreed that there shall be no walking of dogs,” Cele said. “If you really want to walk your dog, do it around your house – it ends there.”
  
  (source)


Currently there's only South Africa with a limitation like this, but nothing stops other countries from applying the same restrictions if the spread of COVID-19 can't be stopped.

How are owners supposed to take care of their dog's toilet needs if dog walking is disallowed? Is there some sensible way, or are they supposed to wait for dogs to make a mess and then clean up? (I'd probably rely on the ""really want to"" case myself, but it seems to be considered an exception by those imposing the restriction.)
",27395,"Dogs - like humans - usually choose a certain place as their ""bathroom"" to do their business there. As long as the poop doesn't pile up without ever disappearing, they will stick to this bathroom.

If your dog is toilet trained, it learned that the bathroom is somewhere outside and never in the house. If you really lock it up inside there are 2 consequences:


Your dog will hold its pee and poop as long as possible, because it cannot go to the bathroom. That is very uncomfortable and can have negative effects on the health.
Sooner or later, your dog has to make a mess, every single day. It'll learn that the toilet is now inside the house and it will be extremely hard to stop this behavior again if the covid-19 crisis is over.


So my best advice is: Go outside for your dogs toiletry needs, no matter what your government says.

The quote implies that your government is very aware that it's impossible to lock dogs inside the house.


  “If you really want to walk your dog, do it around your house – it ends there.”


If you don't have a yard where your dog can do its business, you have a reason to ""really want to walk your dog"". But please stick to the streets / walkways closest to your home and don't wander through half the city into a crouded dog park. If one round around the house isn't enough for your dog, walk 2 or 3 rounds around the house, but do stay close to the house.

I had shown up to buy her sister, Whistlepop, but had left with Whopper - my very own fluffy little malted milk ball. =)  When Whopper was about three years old, she developed Lymphocytic-Plasmacytic Gingivitis Stomatitis (LPGS).  My poor, sweet girl had such problems with her mouth.  It was horrible.  I didn't find online at the time that Birmans were susceptible to this, but Persians were, and I’d found a couple different websites where the authors stated that some people believed the Birman breed had a strong influx of Persian in their development.  There is no cure for LPGS.  During my research, I also found that Birmans had an increased susceptibility to develop FIP.  Whopper never got FIP though.  She died in 2006 right before her 7th birthday of kidney disease.  I didn’t realize there was a problem until it showed up in her pre-surgical bloodwork when she went in to get her teeth cleaned.  By then, she was pretty far along in the progression of the disease.  I was heartbroken.  It’s unusual for a 6-year-old cat to get kidney disease.  When I researched the disease in the Birman breed after she was diagnosed, I found that Persians had a high risk of developing kidney disease, and Birmans had a moderate risk.  I cried for over a year after she died.  It was four years before I could think about her without tears coming to my eyes.  We had been very tightly bonded.

She had a scare with her kidneys about 2 years ago (elevated results of urea and creatine) and has had blood tests regularly since but her levels fell and have been good ever since.

Her brother passed away a few years ago from stomach cancer, and he showed similar symptoms in the beginning but when we've taken her to the vets they've done X-Ray and ultrasound and other than a slight thickening of the stomach lining couldn't see any lumps or anything out of the ordinary. She has also had blood tests and everything looks fine, very good kidney results, no sign of liver issues, no sign of diabetes.

She's been on antacids and laxatives from the vet (as much as we can get in her, she's not good with meds and gets very distressed) but they don't seem to be having any effect.
When she's been in to the vets they sometimes give her an anti-nausea injection which stops her being ill for a few days and then it starts up again.
She's also had antibiotics, dewormer, B12 and a steroid injection at various times. Any improvement is only temporary for a few days and then she starts vomiting again.

She's a fussy eater and she gets dry food (Purina One, various flavours), tuna and white fish. Also occasionally ham. She won't eat much else. She gets sick mostly in the morning and we suspected Bilious Vomiting Syndrome, but she already has food down through the day and gets other regular food throughout the day too, including late at night and that hasn't improved anything.

Most days she might be sick once (and it tends to be thick and dark brown, occasionally with food in or clumps of hair but mostly liquid) but sometimes it's two or three times.
She's otherwise eating fine, drinking and urinating a normal amount and pooing regularly (not sure the laxative is making any difference).

The vets seem to be a bit stumped and just keep telling us to give her the laxatives / antacid but there's obviously something else going on.

The only major change recently is that we were giving her a glycosamine and mineral supplement for arthritis which we were mixing with milk to get her to take it as it was the only way to guarantee she'd take it all. We ran out of the first course a couple of weeks before she started getting sick and didn't get any more before she got ill, so it's been about six weeks since she had the supplement or any milk.

We're really worried but don't know what else to do. Everything is also complicated by the fact we're in the UK and the country is on lockdown because of Coronavirus so while the vet is still open it's not easy to get an appointment.

We're waiting on a stronger antacid from the vets and we're going to try to give her exclusively white fish for a few days to see if diet is contributing (but it's the same diet she's been on for years).

Any ideas what it could be or what we could try next?
The fact she seems to be in good health (particularly for her age) is what's confusing us as all the things we've seen that fit have a list of other symptoms that she just hasn't got.

The negative effect of giving milk is most likely stronger than the positive effect of glycosamine and the mineral suplement.

Giving white fish is a good idea and you can use the juice from the white fish and mix glycosamine and mineral suplement into this,to get the juice out of the white fish you need to do as follows.

Use one of your smallest pots add the white fish(it is best if it have been frozen)add a couple of spoons of water and slowly heat until the water boils,use a fork to split up the fish so it gets heated evenly use little heat you need to keep the water/juice.

You can use a strainer to remove the juice or you can use the fish and juice as it is,cool it down and mix in the glycosamine and minerals hopefully your cat will eat it.

23577,Can I watch the full 'Nice Boat' replacement episode anywhere?,"From KnowYourMeme: (spoilers)


  On the day before the airing of the final episode of School Days in Japan, a 16 year old girl killed her father with an axe in Kyoto. Due to an extremely similar scene present in the episode and to avoid relation to the axe murder, TV Kanagawa replaced it with a half hour of unrelated scenery with “Air on a G String” playing in the background. Among the shock and rage expressed among fans, a 4chan user commented “Nice Boat”, referring to the Norwegian ferry shown in the replacement footage. Immediately the phrase became a meme, however is far more popular in Japan than in English speaking countries.




The part with the boat is easily viewable on Youtube and other sites, but I haven't been able to find the full episode.

Is the episode bundled together with any merchandise or available legally online to stream/download?

",Accepted,"The Sharingan and Mangekyou Sharingan are caused by a special kind of ocular chakra originating in an Uchiha's brain. Usually, a cause of powerful emotion will awaken the Sharingan, and great loss will evolve it into the Mangekyou. Once unlocked, activating them is fairly easy. They can be transplanted, and even retain their abilities. Though it may have been an exception due to its spacetime powers, Kakashi's case showed it could even evolve to the Mangekyou despite not being in an Uchiha. Kakashi could activate and deactivate the Mangekyou form. However, he could never deactivate the Sharingan, and hence had to cover up his Sharingan eye when not in use to preserve chakra.

Next, after Obitos's death, he used his space time powers to transfer his chakra to Kakashi. By doing so, he also transfered his ocular chakra, which temporarily awakened Obito's Mangekyou in Kakashi. Once that Chakra was used up and the Sharingan released, it was gone for good.

Lastly, there is one who went through a very similar situation, Madara. As pointed out, Madara at one time had Obito's Mangekyou and his own Rinnegan. By having a 2nd eye, despite having unlocked the Rinnegan, did not evolve it into a Rinnegan. He even transplanted regular Sharingan before his death, but they did not evolve into Rinnegan either, despite up to several years between him giving his Rinnegan to Nagato, transplanting the spare Sharingan and dying.

Now, of course those were not Madara's real eyes, but the fact that he had the ocular chakra required to awaken even the Rinnegan, but couldn't do so with a Sharingan and a Mangekyou eye says a lot.

With all that established, We have a decent amount of evidence backing up what would happen if Naruto grew a new eye for Obito. Most likely, what would happen is the new eye would be a normal Uchiha eye, which is almost identical to any other regular eye. It would have the potential to unlock the Sharingan and Mangekyou Sharingan, and Obito could probably more easily unlock them than normal, but its impossible to say if it would happen immediately, take months to do so, or anywhere in between.

So, transplanting Obito's left eye into Kakashi, and then having Naruto regrow Obitos eye would likely be able to create 2 eyes with Obito's Mangekyou powers, given an unknown amount of time before he could reawaken his powers.

That however shows the main reason why they didn't do so, besides the situation preventing them from thinking about it. They couldn't risk it not working instantly. Obito was under Zetsus control until Kaguya showed up, and they needed everything they had to just barely pull off that victory. Obito having his left eye's powers is what both got Sasuke out of the dimension Kaguya threw him into alone, and saved Kakashi from her All-Killing Ash Bones. The odds that his new left eye being fully awakened to Mangekyou within the few minutes before it was needed are slim to none. Then after it was used twice in critical circumstances, he turned to ash.

",Reasonable,"I don't recall an exact year, but there's evidence that the series takes place in the modern day, between 2007 and 2018.

The strongest piece of evidence comes from the novels. In Kabukimonogatari Chapter 7, after Koyomi travels back in time 11 years, he notes that the money is different and has Natsume Souseki on it. These would have been the series D bills issued from 1984 to 2007 and suspended April 2007. This puts the series no more than 11 years after 2007, or no later than 2018. The novel version of Otorimonogatari has Nadeko make a reference to K-On, also putting it after May 2007, when the K-On manga started.

Maroon notes in the comments that the dates line up better for 2006. The phasing out of the Souseki notes began in 2004, so 2006 is a plausible year as well. The novels began their run in August 2005, so it's possible that Nisio Isin looked to March 2006 as the starting point for the series.

Smartphones do exist in the world of Monogatari; in the preview on Episode 7 of Nisemonogatari, Kaiki complains that after Hitagi smashed his phone, he went to buy a new one and could only find smartphones, which he dislikes. Here's a hard-to-see picture of my television screen that shows it:



Flip phones are actually still pretty common in Japan; see this Answerman column. 

As a side note, the male protagonist hiding porn books in his room is a time-honored tradition of the genres that Monogatari draws on, harem and school action. Suruga also fills her room up with cheap BL books instead of going on the Internet and reading slash fiction. Monogatari is a mixture of real and hyper-real, so sometimes it just plays by the rules of fiction.

Once you've done that, you'll need to make an account, even if you have an account on Amazon US or Amazon UK or whatever. The process is the same as making an account on any other Amazon site.

The product you want to purchase is either this one for BD, or this one for DVD. In either case, you can pre-order it. If you do place a pre-order, the product should leave Amazon's Japanese warehouse on release day and get to you probably less than a week later.

As far as I know, there is only one option available for global shipping from Amazon Japan. You will be charged probably $10-12 for shipment to the US. I don't know about other countries. If you are in the US, you should choose to pay in USD, so as to avoid foreign transaction fees on your credit card.

Incidentally, you can also preorder the second movie (BD, DVD) for when it releases on 2 Apr 2016.



Much of the advice above is generally applicable to purchasing any BDs and DVDs from Amazon Japan. Amazon Japan isn't always the cheapest option, but it is definitely the most convenient, at least for US-based buyers.

Why is COVID-19 prioritized over other infectious diseases?

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak - WHO



On 2020.01.30, the Director-General of Emergency Committee convened by the WHO declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV (2019 Novel Coronavirus) constitutes a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern).

Actions by country/region:

Hong Kong declares coronavirus emergency. (2020.01.25)

Italy declares state of emergency over coronavirus. (2020.01.31)

U.S.A declared a public health emergency (PHE). (2020.01.31)

South Korea raised threat alert to the highest level. (2020.02.23)

Some provinces of China lower emergency response as epidemic slows. (2020.02.26)

My question:

What are the consequences of PHEIC, to China and to other countries?


",49901,"tl;dr: There aren't any tangible consequences, unless China or other countries decide to take any.



The World Health Organization is an agency of the United Nations. But it does not have any legislative powers. Its activities are limited to spending its budget on funding health-related research, spreading health information and funding healthcare projects which operate within the legal framework of the countries they operate in. 

It might advise governments to take actions, like for example fund healthcare measures, discourage/promote products depending on their health impact, enact quarantines or discourage/promote certain medical procedures. But it does not have the authority to enforce any of those measures themselves.

Now what exactly does it mean that the WHO declares a public health emergency of international concern? It is basically just a declaration, stating that the WHO believes that this is a problem people should take seriously. The WHO has done that 5 times before, each time in case of a global outbreak of an acute infectious disease:


2009 (Swine Flu)
2014 (Polio)
2014 (Ebola)
2016 (Zika)

Italy has just declared some level of regional quarantines.  Legal challenges to this decision by affected individuals would likely be affected by the WHO's declaration.

50066,Why is COVID-19 prompting such wide scale action versus other infectious diseases?,"The COVID-19 outbreak has been dominating the news recently, with loads of headlines and efforts being made to stop it from spreading.

Why this disease? It's not one of the most lethal ones, or one of the deadliest. Compare:


COVID-19 - infected 24,478; deaths 492
Malaria - infected 228 million; deaths 405,000 (2018 data)
Tuberculosis - infected 25% of world population, i.e. ~2 billion; deaths 1.6 million (2017 data)
HIV/AIDS - infected 37.9 million; 1.7 million new cases a year; deaths 770,000 (2018 data)


Compared to malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, the COVID-19 outbreak is pretty much a rounding error.

In terms of lethality, COVID-19 has a case fatality rate of 1.4-6.5%. This is still well below the lethality of tuberculosis (43%) and HIV/AIDS (80-90% after 5 years if untreated), although it is more lethal than malaria (~0.3%)

It seems like, objectively, COVID-19 is a very small fish in the pond of infectious diseases. It's not like the three diseases above are unique either; there're lots more diseases that affect &amp; kill more people than nCoV (e.g. measles, leishmaniosis). Yet, right now, when people die of COVID-19 they make the news, while thousands of people die of the other three diseases every day without getting a mention. Further, COVID-19 is apparently attracting lots of research efforts to treat it. Why is it being prioritized over other infectious diseases?

I'm looking for objective answers as to why COVID-19 matters so much.
",50068,"The short answer to this question is that 2019-nCoV is new. All the other diseases you mentioned are known quantities: epidemiologists have a good idea how they behave, how they spread, what is likely to happen in a variety of different scenarios, etc. But this disease represents a new mutation that behaves differently from other coronaviruses. It's far more transmissible than other coronaviruses, and worse, seems to be transmissible through casual contact: not intimate contact, blood or fluid exposure, not through an intermediary vector like a tick or flea. Currently the death toll is low, but researchers simply do not have enough data to know whether that trend will continue. 

Remember, the death rate of influenza is lower than that of this coronavirus. The 1958 and 1967 influenza pandemics had death rates of about 0.1%, and the 1918 pandemic had a death rate of about 2.5%*. But those pandemics killed millions because they were so transmissible they infected hundreds of millions. If the coronavirus follows that pattern and turns pandemic, we might expect to see any city of a million or so people suffer 20,000 to 30,000 deaths over the course of a couple of months (say 400-500 per day), which is a huge number of people dying by any calculus. Discretion is definitely the better part of valor, here.
",Accepted,"It's been called the ""cycle of oppression"":


  The oppressed group behavior model suggests that persons who are in groups that are subordinate to more powerful groups in their society learn certain behavior patterns that, although necessary for their survival, lead to a cycle of further oppression


I don't know if the term has gained much traction (with this meaning). But it is based on the philosophy of Paulo Freire, who argues it in a bit more detail, as summarized in IEP:


  Freire warns the oppressed against becoming oppressors on two counts: (1) whether the oppressed gain power and use this power to oppress their previous oppressor; or (2) in the case of the oppressed gaining power over other oppressed people and becoming their oppressors, as they seek their own individual liberation. The danger of a previously oppressed person becoming an oppressor is due to their ambiguous duality. Freire points out that the oppressed are at one and the same time both themselves (the oppressed) and the oppressor, whose consciousness they have internalized. Due to this ambiguous duality and the internalization of their oppressors, the oppressed seek to become like the oppressors and share in their way of life.


A more general concept is that history repeats itself, perhaps in ""disguised"" ways.

Some ancient Greeks posited a more elaborate version... the Kyklos:


  According to Polybius, who has the most fully developed version of the cycle, it rotates through the three basic forms of government, democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy and the three degenerate forms of each of these governments ochlocracy, oligarchy, and tyranny. Originally society is in ochlocracy but the strongest figure emerges and sets up a monarchy. The monarch's descendants, who because of their family's power lack virtue, become despots and the monarchy degenerates into a tyranny. Because of the excesses of the ruler the tyranny is overthrown by the leading citizens of the state who set up an aristocracy. They too quickly forget about virtue and the state becomes an oligarchy. These oligarchs are overthrown by the people who set up a democracy. Democracy soon becomes corrupt and degenerates into ochlocracy, beginning the cycle anew.

  On Monday, following mounting criticism of the federal response, Trump administration officials promised a rapid expansion of the country’s testing capacities. With the help of private companies and academic centers, as many as a million diagnostic tests could be administered by the end of this week, said Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
  
  But many scientists wonder if the moves come too late. [...] Most disturbing of all: Did a failure to provide adequate testing give the coronavirus time to gain a toehold in the United States?
  
  “Clearly, there have been problems with rolling out the test,” said Dr. Thomas Frieden, former director of the C.D.C. “There are a lot of frustrated doctors and patients and health departments.”
  
  Still, Dr. Frieden said he thought the situation was improving. Other experts, although supportive of the agency, were mystified that federal officials could have committed so many missteps.
  
  “The incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect with the C.D.C.,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University. “This is not a difficult problem to solve in the world of viruses.”
  
  Officials at the C.D.C. did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The agency abruptly canceled a news conference on Monday just as it was to begin. Officials appeared to have removed figures on the agency website counting how many Americans had been tested.
  
  In February, the C.D.C. rolled out a three-step diagnostic test and distributed testing kits — each of which could run about 800 tests — to state and local health laboratories. But some of the components of the diagnostic kits were flawed, and produced inconclusive results.
  
  A three-step replacement was promised but never arrived; the agency has not fully explained why, except to say that there was a manufacturing defect. As a result, diagnostic testing was only conducted at the agency’s labs in Atlanta.
  
  The C.D.C. eventually rolled out a two-step replacement and permitted a few laboratories, where the kits had been working, to continue using their tests. But those with only one working component of the test still could not diagnose patients on their own.
  
  Getting results from the C.D.C. took days, however, and in any event the criteria for testing were strict — among them, the patient must have had recent travel to China or contact with someone known to be infected.
  
  Doctors nationwide complained of a bottleneck, both because of the restrictive test criteria and because of the agency’s limited testing capacity. The agency said it had the capacity to test about 400 specimens a day.
  
  The test criteria were “too stringent, and people aren’t getting tested,” said Lauren M. Sauer, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine.
  
  [...]
  
  “We have been really frustrated, because one of the things that is a hallmark of public health labs is that we are usually ‘ready, set, go,’ and here we were — ‘ready, set, wait’,” said Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.
  
  Late last week, the Food and Drug Administration broke the logjam, authorizing state and local laboratories to do initial testing on their own. If labs had developed and validated a test, they could use it for diagnosis instead of relying on the C.D.C.’s version or waiting for a replacement.
  
  Other nations have tested patients by tens of thousands. China has probably tested millions.
  
  “How come the South Koreans can do 10,000 tests a day and we can’t?” said Ralph Baric, who studies coronaviruses and emerging diseases at University of North Carolina.
  
  Soon after the virus surfaced in China, the C.D.C. got to work on its own test. “Generally, C.D.C. provides these tests for the world,” said Dr. Frieden.
  
  But German researchers were devising their own test, which was quickly adopted by the World Health Organization for distribution around the world.
  
  After the C.D.C.’s version turned out to be flawed, the agency continued to pursue it, despite the fact that another diagnostic test was already in wide use.
  
  With F.D.A. approval, the agency could simply have distributed the test used by the W.H.O. instead of creating a new one from scratch, Dr. Mina said. The government could do so even now.
  
  “It’s just a very American approach to say, ‘We’re the U.S., the major U.S. public health lab, and we’re going to not follow the leader,’” Dr. Mina said.

  Do individual countries control transit zone law? Or are they covered by international law, since they are international zones?


The former with a twist. Individual countries control transit zones on their territory, as in these are sovereign territory rather than international territory. They're just buffer zones where you keep visitors around until they've effectively crossed the border.

The twist is that, yes, there are international treaties that relate to them -- see e.g. the ones that relate to aviation law. Further, the laws that apply to them continue to evolve. See for instance this paper on Special International Zones, which are glorified mobile international transit zones.

I saw an offhand remark about ""the cost and people not getting tested as a result"", in an online forum.  It wasn't even a claim that it was happening, more like a quip that it might happen.

The US healthcare vs Euro/Canadian-style coverage debate has been done to death, but it usually revolves around the problems lack of coverage brings to the people who are ill.  This is not what I am asking about.

An epidemic situation however brings a different dynamic:  there's a vested interested for everyone else that sick people are identified as such and isolated, it's not just about the being well-being of the patients.  To assist in containment, you want to remove as many barriers to early diagnosis as possible.

Is there/could there be some form of emergency funding for at least the tests themselves, at the federal level?  One model is for example, the financial arrangements around vaccination programs.

Edit:

the question concerns the procedure for the entire test, i.e. lab services as well as clinic time:  seeing a doctor/nurse, taking the tests and getting the results.  Nothing more, but also all of what's necessary for a YES/NO answer wrt having COVID-19 or not.  

Bryan's answer is great wrt to the kit and lab services themselves, but someone still needs to interview you and take whatever samples are necessary to send off for testing,

Do these arrangements vary by state?  Or does the Federal govt, through the CDC, have jurisdiction?

State vs Federal:  it seems to me that a Federal-level guidance ought to be faster than waiting for all 50 states to come up with their own programs individually.

  When contacted by The New York Times, a Rady Children’s Hospital spokesman said the physicians’ bill had been sent in error and that the family would not be held responsible for the charges.


..but it is not clear whether this is a matter of policy or a public relations move by the hospital, nor is it clear how these matters will be handled going forward. It also does not yet resolve the $2600 ambulance bill (of course this is all still pending).

The government can order mandatory quarantines, but as far as who pays:


  “There is no uniform practice,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. “They do have the powers, but they’ve almost never used them in modern times.”


Without some new government intervention, it seems that for now costs will either be charged to patients or simply absorbed by the treating facilities (by not billing).



The American Hospital Association and American Nurses Association on Feb 27, 2020 have asked for the government to fund care related to the epidemic. It seems likely that there will be further political fights over what exactly is done next.



update: As of March 4th, 2020, an agreement was reached in the House on a bill for COVID-2019 funding, which is expected to pass there and later in the Senate. This bill does not address how to deal with care and testing for the uninsured, though it includes state and local funding. It's unclear at this time how those funds could/will be used:


  Congress didn't explicitly address how to handle funding for mandatory quarantines or the uninsured. The package would send $950 million in state and local grants, with half of the money due within 30 days. States will receive a minimum of $4 million.

",Accepted,"The assault weapon ban expired in 2004. 

It banned the following things:


Assault style rifles. (a rifle having at least 2 of: folding or telescoping stocks, pistol grip, bayonet mount, flash suppressor or threaded barrel for one, barrel attached grenade launcher.
Certain modifications to semi-automatic pistols and semiautomatic shotguns. (these are pretty similar to the rifle ban and can be found on wikipedia, I won't list them here).


As you can see, most of the things included in the ban were cosmetic enhancements to a gun. It would be impossible to list specific models as many guns are customizable with any and all of the enhancements that are listed here. So a few specific guns (those listed in the question) were banned, but mostly the ban was governing the style of rifles that could be sold, not the models.

This graphic from the Violence Policy Center shows the modifications made to popular guns to make them compliant with the assault weapons ban. Model numbers we changed, and features were modified (note the lack of a flash supressor on the TEC AB-10, the shorter clip on the Match Target etc), the SSR-74-2 is based on the AK-74 (same family as the AK-47), but uses a different caliber bullet. (It should be noted that as with the SSR-74, some of these are more than cosmetic changes, this is due to the entire model being banned, not the cosmetic bans)



As far as how the banned models differed. You'd see a shotgun with either a folding stock or a pistol grip, not both. Or a rifle with just a pistol grip, but not a folding stock. Or just a bayonet mount, but not a pistol grip, or folding stock.

There was one provision that did have to do with ammunition capacity. High capacity magazines were banned under the law. The law set the maximum capacity for a magazine at 10.

50787,"COVID-19: why are countries still introducing quarantines for travelers from affected regions, even though it's been proven they don't work?","Various governments seem to be playing whack-a-mole with travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines in the recent COVID-19 epidemic. First Chinese residents were banned from numerous countries. Afterwards travel bans expanded to South Korea, Japan, Iran and most recently Italy. Yet despite all the travel restrictions, the virus managed to successfully spread out all across the globe. 

So why continue with the practice of restricting foreign travel, especially when the virus has already been identified to be spreading at the local level? E.g. why doesn't the US remove travel restrictions on Chinese visitors, given that the virus has already been detected in numerous states?

Update: There are now 10 thousand official cases in the US, but travel restrictions are still in place for some reason.
",50790,"While it has clearly been shown by the virility of the virus so far that travel restrictions will not stop the inevitable community spread of the illness, and that their effectiveness as impeding the spread of the virus is small, the aim of the policy is no longer to stop the virus, but to delay it. This was confirmed as current policy in the UK's response to the virus by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, on March 5th.

There are a few reasons why this is the goal of many governments. Firstly, if the peak of the pandemic can be delayed, this allows plans to be put in place for management of the crisis. For example, in the UK, plans have been floated that would allow final year medical students and trainee doctors to take on hospital duties during the nine week period that the virus is currently predicted to have the highest effect on the NHS, in order to mitigate the strain on the service.

Secondly, delaying the spread of the virus allows time for a vaccine to be developed. While research on this is progressing quickly, it will still take time for the vaccine to pass clinical trials and be approved for human usage. In addition, as @Patricia Shanahan points out in the comments, the effectiveness of existing drugs already approved for treating similar respiratory diseases can be evaluated, which could be ready sooner than developing brand new drugs or a vaccine.

Finally, as health services are acknowledged as being under the most strain during the winter months, the best time for the pandemic to peak would be in the middle of summer.

To this end, the policy of travel bans, while having been shown to be relatively ineffective at preventing the spread of the disease outright, is being used to delay the spread of the virus as much as possible, to allow national governments to prepare for the full impact of the peak of the predicted pandemic.
",Accepted,"Background


  Britain's railways were nationalised by Labour in 1948 and returned to private hands by John Major's Conservative government in 1993.
  Labour was initially committed to renationalisation but the policy was dropped when Tony Blair came to power in 1997. Track, signalling and stations were taken out of private hands, and put into a not-for-profit company, Network Rail, after the collapse of Railtrack in 2002.


Why Re-Nationalise?


  The cost of the railway to the taxpayer has subsequently more than doubled in real terms, a rise out of all proportion to the 33% increase in train services over the same period. 
  
  The cost rises stem from wastage as shareholder dividend pay-outs, other inefficient private sector financing and inefficiencies created by fragmentation of the railway.
  
  The wastage amounts to over £1bn per year, enough to cut fares by 20% if the railway were reunified as a public company.
  
  ...run by companies that are wholly or partly publicly owned, but by other countries. Deutsche Bahn is foremost - they even run the Royal Train - and the German Government have said ""We're skimming profit from the entire Deutsche Bahn...it is invested in the rail network here in Germany"". 
  
  So, if you are reading this on an overcrowded train with a ticket that made a painful hole in your wallet, take heart from your generous contribution to improvement of Germany's fine publicly-owned railway. 


In short, re-nationalise to remove the inefficiencies in the fragmented railway system, provide more accountability, prevent ""off-shoring"" of profits from operating the railway network by foreign, state-owned, firms. Finally - make fares cheaper by reducing cost.

Why Keep Privatised?


  The UK's railway network was built privately and competitively and by some way its most successful years were the private eras between 1830 and 1922 and 1994 to the present. 
  
  Returning it to centralised state control would be a step backwards and a mistake. 
  
  Instead we should end the practice of franchising, which creates private monopolies, and allow real competition and diversity.
  
  The solution to our current problems is not more state bungling, it is a return to diversity, competition and open markets.


In short, keep privatised to avoid a step backward, because the railway was privatised during it's most successful years. End franchising which creates per-route monopolies.

50806,Did Bernie Sanders receive low youth voter turnout during the Super Tuesday primaries?,"So a series of news articles are being spread around that purportedly attributes some of Bernie Sanders' losses in states due to low voter turnout.   A quick search on Google reports tens of articles all claiming the same or similar findings:


Google search


However, I recently saw an article on Reddit that says this claim is being falsified by purposely misattributing one statistic as another, but I don't know how verifiable the information is considering it's not a news source I'm familiar with.


Bernie Sanders and the Myth of Low Youth Turnout in the Democratic Primary


If anything, I am more wary of the quantity of news reports. Earlier this month, Snopes.com published a fact-checking article disproving a wide swathe of news reports that Corona beer sales dropped due to fear about the coronavirus, and this is something I am not sure is also going on with the Sanders/youth voter turnout issue.

In any case, did low youth turnout affect Bernie Sanders' results in the Super Tuesday primaries?  Or, as the 2nd linked article claims, is it not true?
",50821,"There's a lot of spin going on in all camps, including the Sanders camp. This is par for the course in a political election year.

The article you cited is guilty of the same criticisms it makes of other articles. It fails to provide any concise information about how many voters in the 18-29 age range in 2020 turned out compared to 2016.

In fairness, this is partly because election officials do not track voters by age when they vote. So the only way to know anything about this kind of metric is to look at the same exit polls the article rejects as inaccurate.

The Sanders campaign, like other campaigns, do their own polling and sampling. So they have pretty much the best idea of anyone as to how well they've really done. So listen to what Bernie himself said:

""Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing in young people in? And the answer is 'no',"" he told reporters at a press briefing on Wednesday.

""We're making some progress but historically everybody knows that young people do not vote in the kind of numbers that older people vote,"" Sanders went on. ""I think that will change in the general election. But to be honest with you, we have not done as well in bringing young people into the process. It is not easy.""

Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-admits-hes-not-inspiring-enough-young-voters-2020-3

However, that's not the only thing we can infer from available data. If you put together a spreadsheet state-by-state to tally vote totals compared to votes received by Sanders, you will see a strong pattern. The data shows that Sanders' overall vote count is running 20-30% LOWER than in 2016 in most states that have voted so far, despite the fact that across-the-board vote count is running 10-30% HIGHER than in 2016. Sanders defenders argue that this is because the field was so much bigger and stronger than in 2016, but I see this as a throwaway argument. If Sanders was really a strong vote-getter, he wouldn't be bleeding support compared to 2016 because the ones who voted for him then already knew him, whereas his opponents this year were mostly newcomers to the primaries. He already had name recognition that the others didn't have among Democratic voters.

So what does this broader insight tell us? Well, all of the polls we've seen say that Sanders' support levels are strongest among the 18-29 age range. So if he's hemorrhaging that much voter support in the overall numbers, it either means that the number of voters in the 18-29 range matched 2016 while the rest of his supporters disappeared almost completely into the woodwork, or (much more likely) his support among 18-29 year olds sagged compared to four years ago along with the other age groups.

Given Sanders' remarks Business Insider quoted, I'd go with the latter likelihood.
",Accepted,"TL;DR


The key founders of Russian Communism have openly declared that the Marxism and religion are „incompatible“. Namely, Marxism has declared the lines of conduct which are opposite to Orthodox Christianity, the most popular religion of the Russia;
Marxism, at least, as it has been understood by Russian Bolsheviks, was a dogmatic, non-scientific belief, hence, a direct competitor to many world's religions of the time.
The Russian Orthodox Church has been adopted by KGB during the times of WWII, when it became apparent that Marxist ideology is not sufficient for controlling the masses.




Yielding the Floor to an Ideologist

First, a note on terminology.
Below, the quotes mistakenly (or deliberately) mix two terms: Marxism (an ideology) and Communism/Socialism (a ruling regime, or a type of a government). The question also contains this mistake. Communism (a regime) can't oppose religion in general, but Marxism (an ideology) can.

Nikolai Bukharin, one of the key ideologists of Russian Communism and prolific author on „revolutionary theory“, wrote in his book, The ABC of Communism (1919):


  Chapter 11: Communism and Religion
  § 89. Why religion and communism are incompatible
  
  Many weak-kneed communists reason as follows: 'Religion does not prevent my being a communist. I believe both in God and in communism. My faith in God does not hinder me from fighting for the cause of the proletarian revolution.'
  
  This train of thought is radically false. Religion and communism are incompatible, both theoretically and practically.
  
  In practice, no less than in theory, communism is incompatible with religious faith. The tactic of the Communist Party prescribes for the members of the party definite lines of conduct. The moral code of every religion in like manner prescribes for the faithful some definite line of conduct.
  
  — marxists.org




Competition

As I mention in another answer, Marxism is an ideology of class supremacy. Proletariat supposed to be the ""master class"", while others are ""lower"" ones.

However, the majority of proletarians were not familiar with Marxist ideology. There was also no goal to teach them with the details of Marxism. As a result, the vast majority of them simply believed that Marxism is right without knowing Marxist ideas in any depth, just the same way as in Tsarist Russia they believed in Christianity while sincerely thinking that Jesus Christ was a Russian, not to mention the deeper aspects of Christianity.

So, there was no place for two competing ideologies, equivalent to each other in most aspects, as it was understood by the overwhelming majority of the population.



Adoption by KGB

However, in 1940s the Stalin's regime has decided that suppressing the religion is not effective:


  After Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. — Wikipedia


By the last years of the „Soviet Union“,


  ""Not a single candidate for the office of bishop or any other high-ranking office, much less a member of Holy Synod, went through without confirmation by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the KGB"" — Wikipedia


Nowadays, the KGB officer codename „Mikhailov“ is allegedly the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church.

50851,Why has Russia declined OPEC's request to cut oil production?,"On Friday, Russia declined to participate in a plan devised by the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut oil production levels, in order to keep oil prices steady in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The article describes this refusal as the cause of the 10% oil price crash on Friday alone, which was exacerbated by a further 30% crash on Monday.

What reasons has Russia given for their refusal to participate in the OPEC group's plan?
",50852,"Disclaimer: I'm no expert, this answer is based on my modest understanding of the situation at play.

The OPEC decision to cut oil production was meant to keep prices high: if every OPEC country were selling all the oil they could, it would drive prices down since there would be more supply than demand. So if every OPEC country agrees to sell only a limited amount of oil, the global supply matches the global demand and prices stay high. Naturally this works only if all the big oil producing countries play the game: it's tempting for a country to sell more than its agreed quota, especially if the price is high.

Russia is not an official member of OPEC, only an observer. As such, it is free to follow OPEC policies or not, depending on its own interests and strategy. I'm not aware of any official reason why Russia refused to follow this particular recent decision, but it looks like a rational economic decision: if many oil producers (competitors) reduce their supply and the prices are high, why would Russia limit their own supply if they have no obligation to?  

""This refusal is cited as the cause of the 10% oil price crash on Friday alone, which was exacerbated by a further 30% crash on Monday.""

This is not the full explanation: the Russian refusal led Saudi Arabia to cancel the original plan to reduce production (Guardian), and instead to flood the market with their own oil. This is what drove prices down sharply, especially in the current context of low demand due to the corona virus.

The Saudi surprise strategy could arguably be interpreted as a kind of tactical response against Russia's refusal to play according to OPEC rules: since Russia apparently wants to reap the benefits of high prices without sacrificing their own production, Saudi Arabia is telling them that ""two can play this game"". The effect is that all the oil producing countries are going to suffer from low prices, but some more than others:


  The new strategy adopted by Riyadh appears to target Russia and US shale oil firms, many of which are known to have high production costs and lose money when crude prices fall below $50 a barrel for more than a few months.


Saudi Arabia can produce oil at a lower cost than Russia and US shale oil industry, so they are probably trying to use the opportunity of the Russian refusal to get rid of some competitors: Saudi Arabia can afford to take a temporary economic hit, whereas many shale oil companies may go bankrupt quickly. Strategically, their initiative is certainly also meant to assert their dominance on the oil market.



[Added: a similar analysis by Kevin Drum, found just after posting my answer]


  The nickel version of this story is that oil prices started declining in February due to fears of lower demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak. OPEC tried to cut a deal with Russia to reduce output all around, but Russia balked. Saudi Arabia then decided to bring out its big guns, lowering prices immediately by about $7 per barrel and announcing that it would increase output in order to take share away from Russia. At that point the decline turned into a rout, with the price of WTI crude collapsing to $28 as I write this.

Putin made his thesis on energy - he knows what role energy plays in both geopolitics and overall economically both internally (for Russia) and globally. While the neocons have surrounded Russia militarily during the last 20 years, which is an existential threat, the control structures in the West have intentionally created an ""everything bubble"", forcing countries like Russia to give up their physical resources with imaginary ""valuable"" printed paper.

What Putin did (and this is why Russia walked out of the OPEC negotiations) was speed up the pricking of the everything bubble - the low oil prices will force the 40% of the junk bond companies (such as shale oil companies) to go bankrupt, which is one of the many negative vortices in the future total reset of the global financial system.

  We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and
  severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore
  made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic,

What significance, if any, does the characterisation that has been made today have?

From the WHO:


  ""Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this #coronavirus. It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do""-

As discussed in this Q&amp;A, the definition of ""pandemic"" is fairly arbitrary. It does identify this virus, both in the present day and in history, as particularly significant, but there is nothing magical that changes with this definition from a political (or epidemiological) perspective, and there appear to be no particular political consequences of the definition from the WHO's perspective.

That is, there are no special funds or protocols that are activated by declaring a ""pandemic"" the way you might expect for various ""declarations of emergency"", which often activate laws that change regulations and procedures during the emergency and may allow for release of funds marked for that purpose.

From the content of the announcement, it seems like the WHO's primary goal in making this declaration is to reiterate the severity of the situation rather than to mark any particular milestone or to alter any guidance or recommendations.

50916,What is the rationale behind delaying the imposition of more radical Covid-19 countermeasures?,"On March 3rd, the UK government released a publication detailing its Coronavirus action plan, which contains the four-stage plan that will be implemented throughout the country, in all four devolved nations, as the impact of the disease continues to worsen. Below is a brief summary of each stage:


Contain - identify cases as soon as possible, and attempt to prevent wider community spread of the virus. Powers have been given to enforce quarantines and extra funding granted to healthcare centres. The goal is to stop the virus from taking hold in the country.
Delay - if containment does not work, measures such as closing schools, banning large gatherings, and incentivising working from home will be introduced. The goal is to delay the inevitable spread of the virus for as long as possible.
Research - if measures taken to delay the virus prove ineffective, focus efforts on researching how to best fight the virus; working out how it spreads, and the best treatment methods. This includes research into vaccine development and deployment.
Mitigate - the last resort scenario, at this point the government will focus on keeping essential services such as police/fire/ambulance functional, as well as bringing retired and newly graduated doctors to the frontlines.


At the moment, the UK Government insists that the country is still in the containment phase, despite the country's Chief Medical Officer and the government's chief medical advisor, Prof. Chris Whitty telling MPs as early as March 5th that the UK ""was now ""mainly"" in the delay phase"".

At first glance the government's refusal to move to the delay phase, despite 460 total cases, and confirmed community spread, seems stubborn and almost deluded, however, the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, Jeane Freeman told MSPs after attending a COBRA meeting on the 10th that 


  The timing of moving into the ‘delay’ phase, and what measures are
  judged to be the most effective in that phase, must be and are driven
  very firmly by scientific and clinical advice. Understandably people
  will be looking to the situation in other countries and questioning
  why some of the moves they are taking are not being made here yet in
  Scotland and in the UK.
  
  [...]
  
  Timing is critical. If we take those measures too soon, we will not
  have the impact we need. If we take them too late, we will not reduce
  demand [on the NHS] to the level we need


What is the risk behind taking these measures - i.e. moving into the delay phase - too soon? I note that Poland, for example, which has a fraction of the cases of the UK, will close all museums, cinemas, &amp; schools from Monday. Why might this be a mistake? Is there any research that has evaluated this?

(Note that although the example I have given is UK-based, I am also interested in answers that refer to the general postponement of more extreme countermeasures internationally)

  Experts have warned about the risk that if tough measures are taken too soon, “fatigue” may set in, prompting the public to disregard the advice just as the virus reaches its peak.


Effectively the argument is that, absent some sort of enforcement squad if people are told to stay in lockdown for a significant period, without a significant scare factor to justify it, then people will assume the risk is actually overblown and start mingling again, just at the moment that many of them are at their most contagious, starting a whole new outbreak in the herd of uninfected.

  On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19, centered on Wuhan in central China, a PHEIC. [...]


It's unclear to me from that if a WHO PHEIC declaration (and thus the obligations following from that) are limited to an area or country that the WHO decides ""to PHEIC"" or is a PHEIC declaration on some concern, e.g. this-or-that-disease ""is PHEIC'd"" automatically entails that all IHR member countries have to respond similarly, e.g. report [all] cases of that disease. So what's the (geographical) scope of a PHEIC? Does the WHO have the latitude to ""customize it""?
",50926,"A PHEIC declaration does not apply to a specific area - it is just that, a declaration by the WHO that the Directory-General has determined that a public health emergency of international concern exists pursuant to Article 12 of the International Health Regulation (2005). Paragraph 5 of Article 12 states that


  If the Director-General, following consultations with the State Party
  within whose territory the public health emergency of international
  concern has occurred, considers that a public health emergency of
  international concern has ended, the Director-General shall take a
  decision in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 49.


Paragraph 6 of Article 49 states that 


  The Director-General shall communicate to States Parties the
  determination and the termination of a public health emergency of
  international concern, any health measure taken by the State Party
  concerned, any temporary recommendation, and the modification,
  extension and termination of such recommendations, together with the
  views of the Emergency Committee.


Here, States Parties refers to all state parties to the IHR - so any declaration of a PHEIC is therefore applicable globally, and obligates state parties to notify the WHO of any local spread of the disease. Notably, the declaration of a disease to be a PHEIC does not actually introduce new obligations to state parties directly, but as states are required under Article 6 to


  notify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by
  way of the National IHR Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment
  of public health information, of all events which may constitute a
  public health emergency of international concern within its territory
  in accordance with the decision instrument, as well as any health
  measure implemented in response to those events


the designation of the disease to be a PHEIC means that the event is notifiable, and as a result, the declaration of a PHEIC affects all state parties by definition.

However, if we refer back to Article 49, note that the Director-General is obligated to communicate temporary recommendations with regard to public health. These temporary recommendations are non-binding and time-limited, and are described further in Article 15, paragraph 2 of which states that


  Temporary recommendations may include health measures to be
  implemented by the State Party experiencing the public health
  emergency of international concern, or by other States Parties,
  regarding persons, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods
  and/or postal parcels to prevent or reduce the international spread of
  disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic.


Therefore, these temporary recommendations need not be globally applicable, and can apply to just one, or a few state parties.

In conclusion then, while the declaration of a PHEIC is applicable globally, the temporary recommendations issued as a result of the declaration are not required to be, and in general, aren't.
",Accepted,"Most classical liberals respect property rights as the foundation of a liberal economy. One definition of a property right is a state granted monopoly on the use of an object.

Many consider John Locke the founder of classical liberalism. In a Lockean state of nature (see chapter two), people gain property rights by taking the unimproved land and putting themselves into it through labor. Once they have done this, they have a right to the land. They can voluntarily decide who enters it.

Copyright law is very similar to this Lockean viewpoint. I took unused words and put my labor into it to create a story. I now have mastery over this story and may decide who uses it. 

Copyright law, however, has many difficulties. 


What if two people write the same book independently? What if someone
else's book is just very similar?  
How does copying your book harm
you? What about my right to do whatever I want on my property?


But land ownership also has many unclear difficulties as well.


Can I play my music very loudly if it enters your land? Exactly how
loud? What about my right to do whatever I want on my property? 
What if I take the oil beneath your land while only drilling on my land?
Can I go on your land at night or if you're not there? What if I'm
very quiet and respectfully leave as soon as I see you? How does that
harm you?


Based on their similar origins and a broadly similar level of difficulty in defining and enforcing, it is reasonable that a classical liberal could find copyright law an acceptable form of property rights.

50943,Why are non-Schengen countries excluded from the Covid-19 US travel ban?,"The US government suspended travel from Europe to US, except for countries which are not in the Schengen area such as the UK and Ireland.

Many comments from EU leader seem to assume that this is a political decision rather than a health-based decision, especially with regard to this exception.

Is there any official rationale for this exception?
",50944,"The official rationale, according to Trump's presidential proclamation, is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could become overwhelmed ""if sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred in the United States on a large scale"". It continues:


  The World Health Organization has determined that multiple countries
  within the Schengen Area are experiencing sustained person-to-person
  transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
  
  [...]
  
  The Schengen Area currently has the largest number of confirmed
  COVID-19 cases outside of the People’s Republic of China.  As of March
  11, 2020, the number of cases in the 26 Schengen Area countries is
  17,442, with 711 deaths, and shows high continuous growth in infection
  rates.  In total, as of March 9, 2020, the Schengen Area has exported
  201 COVID-19 cases to 53 countries.  Moreover, the free flow of people
  between the Schengen Area countries makes the task of managing the
  spread of the virus difficult.
  
  The United States Government is unable to effectively evaluate and
  monitor all of the travelers continuing to arrive from the Schengen
  Area.  The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by
  infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from the
  Schengen Area threatens the security of our transportation system and
  infrastructure and the national security.  Given the importance of
  protecting persons within the United States from the threat of this
  harmful communicable disease, I have determined that it is in the
  interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend
  the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of
  all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during
  the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the
  United States.


The reasoning exposed in the proclamation, then, is that due to the lack of travel restrictions between Schengen countries, it is far harder to manage the spread of the disease by controlling inter-Schengen migration. This factor is attributed by the proclamation as the main cause of community spread throughout the 26 member countries, and even goes as far as to tacitly blame the international spread of the disease on the area.

At a practical level, consider someone arriving to the USA from Slovenia, a member of the Schengen area. While Slovenia itself only has 31 cases currently, it is impossible for USA immigration officials to tell whether that person has just driven from Italy, which has over 10,000 cases. As a result, the Trump administration seems to have decided that the best way to deal with this issue is a blanket ban (with some exceptions, e.g. US citizens, travellers invited by the US to aid efforts against Covid-19 etc. See proclamation for full details) on travel from the Schengen area countries and visitors who have visited the area within the last 14 days, the incubation period of the disease.

Travellers from a non-Schengen area, however, seem to be presumed to be able to prove that they haven't been in any Schengen countries in the last 14 days by their passport records, and as such the level of risk they pose should be able to  be more easily evaluated.

However, as pointed out in the comments, inter-European travel does not involve passport stamping in some cases, for example from Italy to the UK, so it will be difficult to identify these travellers practically. It is unclear how immigration officials will mitigate this.

The reasoning of the proclamation, however, remains that travel restrictions could be easily imposed between, to use our example, Italy and the UK, meaning that travellers from the UK are lower risk.

Update 14/03: The travel ban has now been extended to the UK and Ireland, which calls into question the original official rationale, but does not change it.

50945,Are de facto Schengen countries exempt from the Covid-19 US travel ban?,"President Trump's presidential proclamation specifically defines the countries affected by the ban as the 26 signatories to the Schengen Treaty:


  For purposes of this proclamation, the Schengen Area comprises 26
  European states: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
  Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia,
  Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway,
  Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.


However, four European states also maintain open or semi-open borders with the Schengen area, namely Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, &amp; Vatican City. Clearly travellers from these countries will also be subject to the separate ban on people that have visited Schengen countries in the last 14 days, but considering the (semi)open borders, there should be no way to definitively prove this status one way or the other.

Are these countries exempt from the ban? Is this an oversight by the Trump administration, or do methods exist to identify travellers from these countries who have recently returned from the Schengen area proper?
",50947,"Given that none of these countries have their own international airports, and all but Monaco are landlocked, it's effectively impossible for nationals of those microstates to reach the US without visiting a Schengen country.

  Today the Fed announced a $1.5 trillion liquidity provision to the interbank lending market — primarily in the form of “repurchase agreements.” The interbank lending market comprises the federal-funds market (in which the Fed actively participates on a daily basis) and the repurchase-agreement (or “repo”) market (in which the Fed intervenes primarily when there is a lack of liquidity). In the repo market, one financial institution temporarily trades securities to another institution, with the understanding that it will repurchase those securities in the near future (usually the next day). Banks with large balance sheets often need access to quick cash to conduct regular operations, and the most practical way to get that cash is through repos. Otherwise, managing their balance sheets would be needlessly onerous.

",Accepted,"If you consider CO2 emission as the source of climate change, then only a reduction of CO2 emission can be the ultimate solution to the problem.
Thus, emitting less CO2 is the goal. However, some fields lend themselves more to CO2 reduction than others. While it is relatively straight forward to replace cars with internal combustion engines with electric vehicles; electricity generation can be switches only in a much larger time frame. Whereas e.g. steel production will turn out to be a very tricky one. You simply can't run a blast furnace with electricity.

That is where the technologies which focus on recyling or storage of CO2 come into play. If you can't stop a blast furnace from emitting CO2, you can capture the CO2 and do something, e.g. turn it into other chemicals.

However, in total more CO2 reduction is achieved by not emitting the CO2 in the first place.

50999,Why did the French government not cancel elections because of Covid-19?,"France held local elections even after coronavirus related restrictions had to be put in place. 

The article mentions only this rather general and vague reason for holding them:


  Macron decided to go ahead with the elections last week, saying it was
  vital the democratic system to continue functioning.


Clearly holding an elections means that lots of people are walking around and since the coronavirus spreads much easier that other viruses, it kind of defeats the purpose of existing restrictions.

Isn't it possible to delay elections in France?

Also, it is expected that voter turnout to be lower due to people being afraid of going out.

Question: Why did the French government organized elections as planned in spite of coronavirus restrictions?
",51011,"Scientists advising the government told them that, with appropriate measures (such as soap everywhere, >1m distance between everyone, etc.), it was no more dangerous than going to buy some food, which is still authorized.

  Le conseil scientifique a considéré qu’il n’y avait pas d’élément
  pour penser qu’il y aurait un surrisque pour ces personnes à condition
  que les élections soient organisées de façon pratique
  
  The scientific committee considered there was no element indicating
  more risk [to go vote than to go shopping] for those people [elderly
  people], if the elections are organized in a practical way.


There is also a question of politics and timing : on Thursday morning all parties asked that it be maintained (in particular the right-wing Senate president, who is now blamed for it), so they had to decide that. 
However, later the same day, the confinement measures were decided, which seemed to contradict the possibility to vote. But politically it was too late, cancelling the elections would go against advice given by all parties on Thursday morning. 
Since Macron was expected to lose the elections (which he mostly did), cancelling the election after every other party expressed against it would have been seen as an antidemocratic political maneuver.

Some of the opposition parties have since then declared that they only accepted to maintain the elections before the confinement measures were decided, and thus that they could not decide in all knowledge, and would have changed their minds after the confinement measures were announced.

51000,Does the World Health Organization have the power to impose sanctions?,"In the last couple of days, WHO officials have criticised the UK government's approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, describing the government's reliance on developing herd-immunity amongst the British population, and apparent reluctance to put in place quarantines as ""ridiculous"".

China has also been criticised for its initial response to the virus, which the Financial Times describes as a ""cover-up"", and which US national security advisor Robert O'Brien says ""cost the world community two months"" in terms of preparation for the disease. This would appear to be in breach of the International Health Regulations (2005), Article 6 of which states that:


  Each State Party shall notify WHO, by the most efficient means of
  communication available, by way of the National IHR Focal Point, and
  within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all
  events which may constitute a public health emergency of international
  concern within its territory


Given the criticisms above, does the World Health Organization have any powers to either enforce health recommendations such as quarantines or lockdowns, powers to punish or sanction countries that refuse to comply with said health recommendations, or powers to punish countries that breach their obligations under the IHR?

  WHO officials have criticised the UK government's approach to the COVID-19 pandemic


Actually the quoted criticism does not come from the WHO, nor from a current employee of the WHO. It comes from 


  Professor Anthony Costello, ex-director of maternal and child health at the World Health Organisation


The criticism is of the claim that the UK government should


  ""just let 60% of the population get it""


These appear to be the words of a radio presenter not a published policy of the UK government.

The UK's Health Secretary recently said Herd immunity is not the policy of the UK government.


  “Herd immunity is not our policy. It’s not our goal. Our goal is to protect life and our policy is to fight the virus and protect the vulnerable and protect the NHS. And that’s what we’re doing. Now there is a, of course there’s a scientific debate around scientific concepts, but I want to be absolutely crystal clear that we will do what is necessary to protect life,”


So the premise is questionable.



The subject of herd immunity and the 60% figure came from an interview with the chief scientific adviser to the UK government. He was apparently speaking about the conditions for a potential resurgence of COVID-19 next winter and beyond. 




  Does the World Health Organization have the power to impose sanctions?


Not really, not of the sort the question seems to suggest.

The WHO did impose sanctions on a news-media organisation that leaked information in advance of a publication date. WHO banned the organisation from its press conferences for two weeks.

Any UN member state can apply for membership of the WHO. It seems likely the WHO can, as a sanction, expel a member from the WHO. I suspect only the UN itself could expel a state from the UN.

In the past, the WHO has been associated with criticisms of punitive sanctions on countries as hampering the objectives of the WHO. The WHO seems to generally aim to assist rather than punish countries.

Like any individual or organization, the WHO can advocate for or against a sanction. As a UN specialized agency it is likely to be listened to by the UN assemblies. As I understand it, it does not have the power itself to commit the UN to sanctions.

It is normally UN member states who would apply and enforce punitive sanctions following a resolution of the UN security council of which the UK is a permanent member with veto rights.

51038,Why do Western countries seem to be less efficient than Asian countries in fighting against COVID-19?,"So far it appears that Western countries especially in Europe (e.g. Italy, Spain, UK, France, Germany) struggle to curb the spread of COVID-19. This is in contrast to most Asian countries (China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore) which were hit by the virus earlier, but managed to reduce the contagion through drastic containment measures.

While it's probably too soon to evaluate the effect of the strong measures which have been implemented in the past few days in many European countries, it looks as if Western countries have been reluctant and/or unable and/or inefficient at implementing the methods used in Asia to fight the contagion. It also looks as if Asian countries are expected to be more disciplined and/or organized than Western countries (example).

Are there any objective reasons why Western countries are less efficient than Asian countries in the fight against COVID-19?

Added: For example, are there different political choices which were made before and during the outbreak? Are there structural differences, for instance in the way governments can deploy resources in a crisis? 
",51040,"Part of it is going to be that the region (HK, Singapore, SK?, China) was hit much harder during the 2003 SARS epidemic so spent more time getting prepared.

Also, it has long been the expectation that the next epidemic would come out of China, both due to population density and proximity to livestock/wild animals, so those countries could expect another ""gift"" from their Chinese neighbors.

Japan?  It's relatively unscathed so far, but it is an isolated island, with comparatively few foreigners which isn't on great terms with its Asian neighbors.  As @bobsburner mentioned, ""travel density"" counts for a great deal with covid-19.  For now - counting it as luck, might become skill later.  Or its success might just be down to not-testing, as @steros says.

Supply chains are in Asia.  This is being shown as an Achilles' heel of Western service-oriented economies:  if we need to ramp production of electronic testing kits or ventilators, we are cut off from a lot of the world's manufacturing capacity.

Collectivism vs. individualism has a part to play in it as well:  it's more difficult for a Western politician to push drastic measures like quarantine (let alone China's dictatorial system).  Still, Italy was pretty quick to do so, because they had no choice.  Still, the cultural traits leading to quick acceptance by the community of harsh limitations on individual liberties seems to be an Asian advantage at this point:

Here's a Medical Sciences Stack Exchange answer re. isolation, testing and surveillance procedures followed in Guangdong, near HK, so not Wuhan at all.  An article partly covering Wuhan itself.  And we've heard of the one-week hospitals.  We're just not there yet, in terms of mobilization. Or coercion.

Constant deficit spending.  A country like Italy is at 130%+ GDP debt.  They've resisted pressure to shape up their finances, tax collection, pension payments, etc... for decades.  They just don't have anything left to surge spending in emergencies.  This applies to just too many European economies.

It's also really too early to say much about the final outcome.  Currently South Korea and China are better at getting the disease under control, but what really counts is the long run.  If a few dozen people in Wuhan spread the disease rapidly in January then we need to be ready to wait this out for a while - ""social distancing &amp; quarantines"" for 3 months, then relaxing will result in restarted epidemics.

There's also, esp. at the start, plain luck.  The 2003 SARS epidemic hit Canada's west coast less than Toronto, because a doctor got bad vibes about a patient with breathing problems and she isolated them, before any outbreak was known.  In Toronto the same type of cases mingled with the general hospital staff and patients and the outbreak was much worse.  In Italy 1 covid case was not identified as such and went to the hospital 4 times, interacting with everyone else.  S. Korea had a massive cluster early on, but it was within a religious sect, which might interact less with others.

It's hard to really assign a ""good vs bad"" label to early spread.  Past that, the quality of political leaders and their ability to balance out economic/social reality vs medical advice (which is still operating in uncertainty - witness the UK's ""herd"" approach) is going to be key.  This is a good time to be listening to experts, and there some of the Asian technocrats are a definite better bet than some of the West's populists.  I know I wouldn't be thrilled to have Duterte in the Philippines in charge, for example, and he's Asian.

Rather than competition and comparisons, it might be useful to see what has been achieved so far:  to some extent S. Korea and China have shown that aggressive testing and quarantines can slow the disease, Australia was very quick to sequence the bug's genome, we got a test within weeks! and some Western countries are starting to look at and evaluate candidate vaccines.  We are much better off in 2020 than if SARS had had that kind of punch in 2003.

COVID-19 was detected the first of December 2019, but at a fish market that couldn't possibly be the source of the new strain, it means that the virus was already going around for an unknown amount of time. Two more months passed before China decided a lockdown. So much time passed that it is possible that the epidemic was close to its peak and that most of the people were infected and had already developed the antibodies. Therefore your assumption you base the question on, that the Western countries are struggling more than China, might not be correct.

Edit:

I see that you changed your title and you changed the assumption from the Western countries struggling more than China to the Asian countries that seem to be more efficient than the European countries. This changes the subject and the meaning of my answer. While the previous assumption was dubious, but more precise, the second is confused and full of implications difficult to prove: 

When you say that Asian countries seem to be more efficient are you implying that all of them where affected in the same way and reacted in the same way? There is an enormous amount of differences among them. Japan and South Korea contained the spread more easily. But why? Did they interacted more with Chinese people coming from other regions? Was it due to better weather conditions? Was it due to the hygienic conditions that already existed there independently from the epidemic? There are a lot of variables here. But then How can you relate Japan with a country like India where the hygiene condition are worse, but the weather conditions are a lot more difficult for a virus like an influenza?

Furthermore we know almost nothing about what happened and what is happening in countries like Iran, does your question also imply that Iran seem to be more efficient than Western countries?

51090,Why are Central Banks cutting interest rates in response to COVID-19?,"Central Banks around the world have cut interest rates in the past few days in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the US Federal Reserve (0-0.25%), the Bank of England (0.1%), and the Reserve Bank of Australia (0.25%). Notably, the European Central Bank has not yet cut interest rates further, but this is partly because it is already in the negatives, at -0.5%.

Why are central banks taking this measure in response to this pandemic in particular - i.e. how does this measure lessen the pandemic's economic impact - and what are the impacts on the average consumer of a cut in their country's central bank interest rate in general?
",51096,"By lowering interest rates the Fed's main goal is to prop up the stock market, and support US corporations.

This is achieved through the following effects:
- it encourages credit creation through bank lending, and because most money originates in credit it makes money cheaper and more widely available
- it lowers the rates of return on savings and thus encourages savers to spend more freely, which has a twofold effect: it stimulates the economy into the creation of yet more loans, and it tells savers to go elsewhere with their money

The resulting availability of money/credit and lowered bank savings rates makes the stock market an attractive destination.

Since 2007, the financial crisis, the Fed is essentially a hostage of the stock market in that if now must keep loose monetary policy to further the illusion of perpetual long term stock market gains. This is further evidenced by the tentative and then aborted QT (quantitive tightening) attempt last year. 

In the current climate of coronavirus economic meltdown, the lowered interest rate has a further goal: to help protect US corporations who are now overstretched on corporate bonds.

Since 2007, unbeknownst to many, and I think illegal outside the US (?) , corporations  - rather than restructure in the wake of the crisis - regularly take advantage of the cheap money stimulus by issuing corporate bonds (essentially borrowing money at low rates) so that their execs can use this to direct the company to purchase its own stock on the stock market. This creates the illusion of rising corporate value while allowing shareholders to receive big dividends and CEOs to pay themselves income related bonuses.

This irresponsible corporate behaviour has brought US corporations to the point that the coronavirus meltdown has slowed earnings below what they need to pay on the corporate bonds. Without direct government support many US corporations will go bust, and corporate bond prices will plummet, which will trigger further meltdown in financial institutions that invest in those assets.

Again, silently under the media radar, just this week the US (?) and ECB created new funds that will be directed to supply money to those institutions buying corporate bonds. To be clear, the way that works is that bondholders who are now nervous about the corporation defaulting might not roll over their bond....rather than reacquiring bonds at the end of their term, or even ending prematurely, they will demand their money from the corps. The corps. don't have it, but new bonds will be sold to the govt backed funds. (Once again the taxpayer bails out the fatcat)

So in summary, the reduced interest rate in combo with new funds, is designed to prop up the stock market and corporations to prevent socioeconomic collapse.

Around the world, central banks lower the rate for the effects of stimulus and stock market prop-up described above. ECB does not lower because the negative interest rate actually makes loans more expensive in some cases as being paid to borrow makes it easier than to lend.

It entered this crisis with debt levels of 'only' 103% of GDP, and over the entire debt crisis, this only increased to 181% of GDP.

How is Japan able to withstand this level of debt without entering a debt crisis similar to Greece? Is this the right metric to look at, or are there other factors specific to either country?
",51105,"Their economies are radically different otherwise.


Greece has a weak economy in most fields, with the exception of tourism.  Japan is a manufacturing and scientific powerhouse.
Greece runs recurring high deficits and had rarely, if ever, shown inclination to stop doing so.  While Japan was criticized at the start of their financial decline for insisting on balanced budgets instead of stimulating demand.
Tax collection.  Japan does it.  Greece didn't.
Japan could devaluate its currency if necessary to adjust its finances.  Greece couldn't, being on the euro.
Japanese government debt is, I believe, mostly owed to Japanese investors and denominated in yen, unlike Greece's.
Japan has demonstrated for decades that it can pay its bills, on its own.  Greece on the other hand just seemed as if the only thing that kept it up was euro membership.
Greek official statistics were not, and had not for a while, been trusted.  They're still prosecuting the guy who showed they were cooking the books.


Until 2008, Greece was only getting charged a 0.25% point premium over German bonds based on the tacit assumption that Europe (Euro-zone) would never let Greece go broke. Investors, out of greed and risk un-awareness (or trust in European taxpayers gullibility), parked their money in Greek bonds, rather than German ones, just to get that extra 0.25% point.

From https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Publications/Annrep1999.pdf (I find it hard to set hard time limits on Google to only look at stuff from before a date):


  Specifically, the yield differential between the Greek and the German 10-year
  bond fell from roughly 270 basis points at end-1998 to about 200 basis points in March
  1999 (see Chart VI.1).


At the start of the general crisis, investors started wondering if trusting that Europe would always back Greek debt, even when undergoing a Europe-wide crisis, was a wise idea.  Once perception soured, the game was up very quickly.  Financing costs for Greek government debt went up, fast.  Any refinancing happened at progressively higher rates.  A debt that looked bad at the previous, lower, rate seemed like it would result in a short term default.  People still loaned to Greece, but the premium to do so was massive and made this very quickly unsustainable.

The plug was pulled, late high-rate private and non-European investors got a haircut.  Europe's taxpayers paid up enough money for Greece to keep paying slightly lowered interests, at deferred times, to the big German and French banks so they wouldn't take too massive a loss (and so that loss of confidence wouldn't spread, as per @Machavity answer).

Most Greek debt remained in place, unlike what happens in say an Argentinian default.  In fact, money ""helpfully"" loaned to keep Greece from defaulting on interest payments just got added to the overall debt.  In a way, though it fully deserved the initial mess it got, that's the tragedy of Greece.  Instead of the reset that comes with a default, Greeks got this unending misery of servicing a debt which is only pretended to be fully recoverable from (as most of my post is critical, I want to stress that, IMHO, the Greek people don't deserve to live through this for decades).

But no one is too willing to put their hands in that wolf's jaws anymore.

As o.m. says, mostly perception. Until COVID-19 at least, Japan looks like it has a few good years left for investors, most of whom are Japanese and have little interest in rocking the boat.  This is not to say it is financially healthy, only that it is under less external pressure.

Greece relies on foreign money, didn't look good in 2008 and doesn't now.  In most other conditions, big chunks of that 181% would have been written off as unrecoverable already.

51108,Why can one still buy newspapers during lockdown?,"In the middle of the Covid-19 lockdown, at least in France and in Italy newsagents are in the list of first-necessity stores that remain open. ""To go buy a newspaper"" is a legitimate reason to leave one's house.

I wonder about the motivations of this decision: buying a newspaper is not essential by any definition of the term. Television, radio and internet are largely sufficient to cover the need for information of the general population.

Is there a reasonable political explanation for this? At first sight, it seems that the only one is the ties and the balance of power between politicians and news outlets / medias.
",51109,"At least in Italy, this appears to be in part a response to pressure from newspapers and their readers. On March 11th, the director of la Repubblica newspaper Carlo Verdelli published (in Italian) an article asking for newsagents to be included in the list of essential services, saying that ""The list is missing a service that is more fundamental 
 now than ever before, that of information"". He went on to state that ""If [newsagents] were not included in the list, it would cause irreparable damage, not only for newspapers, but most importantly for the citizenry."" (my translation)

This is an important point, as a study undertaken by the Pew Research Center in 2017 found that while TV and online media dominate, 31% of Italians and 23% of French adults get their news from print media at least daily. This group is likely to be composed of older citizens who will be most affected if they contract the virus, and although this puts them at more risk if they leave their houses to buy a newspaper, it is of higher importance to keep at-risk groups informed. 

In addition, another Pew Research Center study found that newspapers were especially important for coverage of local news that would not otherwise be reported in alternative media - although the study was limited to the US, this is another potential factor that could have influenced the decision.

It seems that France and Italy have decided that informing the populace is especially important in this time of crisis, and that this outweighs the threat public health and the potential spread of disease that the inclusion of newsagents as an essential service poses.
",Accepted,"There are probably several reasons for the Russian government to be making these claims. Obvious possibilities include: 

They're talking to the Russian population, not the rest of the world

The Russian economy is not doing well, so it's worth focussing the population's attention on external threats. This will tend to distract them from discontent over their living conditions, the steady concentration of power and wealth in the government and its immediate allies, and so on. 

We don't know how healthy the Russian strategic deterrent is

The government is short of money, but they have a lot of missiles to maintain.

It's a negotiating strategy

If they make a fuss about a missile defence system, they might be able to get some concession in exchange for accepting it. 

The Russians don't regard the Iranian threat as credible

The missile defence systems installed in Poland a decade ago were explicitly for defence against Iranian missiles. The Russians didn't regard that threat as credible, mainly because they feel that the Iranian government is somewhat rational and capable of being deterred by US strategic weapons, and by French and UK SLBMs. 

So they don't see any threat that that the missile defence system could be used against, apart from Russia. 

They suspect the missile defence system can be rapidly strengthened

One claimed reason why the missile defence system ""can't be intended for use against Russia"" is that the numbers of missiles are too small to make a significant difference. However, rapid production of weaponry has been an American speciality in the past. The present-day procurement system is quite inefficient, but that could be changed.

51121,"Why is Trump dubbing COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus"" considered offensive, while many past epidemics have had similar naming schemes?","To preface this, I'm not a supporter of Trump, but I disagree with the way some major media outlets have criticized him over his nickname for COVID-19, the ""Chinese virus"".   In addition, it is not only those outlets, but other governmental organizations like the WHO that have advised against dubbing COVID-19 in such a manner.

In the past we have had cases where a widespread global epidemic has also been referred to other countries or nationalities, such as:


The ""Spanish Flu"", although it should be known that the Spanish flu had origins little to do with Spain itself.
The ""Russian Flu"" or ""Asiatic Flu""
The Japanese Smallpox Epidemic
The Asian Flu and the Hong Kong Flu
The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which has been referred to as Saudi Arabia's SARS-like virus.


In any case, is the media backlash over Trump's nickname for COVID-19 justifiably warranted? Is there a problem in the way COVID-19 has been nicknamed?
",51122,"Let's appreciate the learning curve. The problem with all of those historical names is that they created sharp spikes in prejudice, social ostracism, and violence against the indicated groups, and still create issues today as seen here with COVID-19. It's true that the first identified cases of Covid-19 occurred in Wuhan China, but this does not imply that people of Chinese descent — or even people recently emigrated from China — are vectors for the disease, or in any way responsible for the problems that the disease causes. But in the minds of an unfortunate number of ignorant people, the mere association of the disease with Chinese heritage can produce verbal and physical assaults, and/or other social pressures that can prevent Chinese people in any walk of life from getting access to necessities or essential services. 

Trump's very public insistence on calling this the 'Chinese virus', backed by his status as president, is guaranteed to significantly increase acts of discrimination and assault on people of Asian descent (whether or not they are specifically Chinese). It guarantees this merely by giving an authoritative affirmation to the most panicked, emotional, and ignorant portion of our society that those 'Chinese' are in some way responsible for the spread of Covid-19.

No doubt Trump does this intentionally. Trump thrives on the panicked, angry ignorance of others; that emotional state he knows how to manipulate to his own profit. And while he himself may not be concerned with the secondary impact of increased violence against people of Asian descent, people of Asian descent have a good deal to worry about.

A president ought to have the presence of mind not to inflame racial tensions in a situation where tensions are already running exceedingly high. Even if we wanted to argue that there is nothing terribly wrong with the phrasing in and of itself — that it's just a poor choice of words by a man whom no one considers to be eloquent, perhaps — misstatements by someone who is (ostensibly) the leader of the free world have significant consequences. If even one Asian American gets attacked because of someone emboldened by Trump's poor word choice, that is blood on Trump's hands.

There is no official time limit on how long this can take. Historically, the fastest amendment was the 26th, which took 100 days, while the slowest was the 27th, taking more than 200 years. Wikipedia has a nice table which includes the timing of amendments in the past.

Practically speaking, the amendment process is complicated enough that an amendment is unlikely to pass quickly in order to help a particular candidate.

In the specific case of the Democrats trying to do it right now in 2019, it's not possible. Proposing an amendment requires two thirds of both houses of Congress or two thirds of the legislatures of the states. Democrats do not control two thirds of either house, nor do they control two thirds of state legislatures. This means that Democrats, acting alone, cannot propose any Constitutional amendments at this time. Actually ratifying an amendment requires three fourths of the state legislatures or conventions in three fourths of the states, an even higher bar that likewise won't be met. Neither party has the kind of supermajority required to pass amendments that the other party doesn't support.

51124,How did the US administration usually refer to COVID-19 before the Chinese foreign ministry started claiming the virus is of US origin?,"It's been recently reported that Trump's administration (Trump himself, but also Pompeo) has been referring to COVID-19 as ""China virus"" or ""Wuhan coronavirus"" etc., emphasizing the Chinese origin of the virus, despite the WHO's recommendations against using such geographical labelling.

The Trump administration says they are doing this (now) to combat (apparently recent) Chinese propaganda that the COVID-19 was introduced by the US Army to Wuhan during a (friendly) visit. (An accusation for which, I have to say, the Chinese political officials presented no real evidence, and which seems to contradict even what the Chinese scientists have been saying about the same issue.)

How did the US administration (top officials) usually refer to COVID-19 before the Chinese foreign ministry started to make such (unsupported) accusations (i.e. roughly before March 12)?
",51134,"Usually, the Trump administration referred to the virus as ""coronavirus"", ""the coronavirus"", or, more commonly in press releases and official documents, the official WHO name of  ""COVID-19"". The response team headed by VP Mike Pence was termed the ""Coronavirus Task Force"", for example.

There are however, instances prior to March 12th, when the allegations were tweeted by a Chinese official for the first time, where a location was attached to the disease. 

As far back as the start of February, White House chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow described the virus as ""the Chinese virus"" in an interview with Fox Business Network.

Mike Pompeo and Republican Senators &amp; Representatives repeatedly used the term ""Wuhan Virus"" in press briefings and in debates in the weeks leading up to the 12th. On the 9th, GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted a link to the CDC website, saying that it offered ""Everything you need to know about the Chinese coronavirus"".

On March 10th, Trump retweeted a tweet by Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, which calls the virus ""China Virus"" and says that ""the US stands a chance if we can control of our borders""(sic). In his address on March 11th which announced the travel ban to Schengen countries, Trump described the disease as a ""foreign virus"".

It should be noted that this is not specific to the Trump administration, indeed, before March, many media outlets also included a geographic adjective in their reporting, including the BBC, the Guardian, Al Jazeera, the Financial Times, Reuters, Scientific American, the Associated Press, the Global Times, and the Washington Post, amongst others. This term then fell out of use towards the end of February, as this analysis by Axios shows, being replaced by the WHO sanctioned terms. 

In conclusion, then, while US administration officials usually used the term ""coronavirus"", or the medical term ""COVID-19"", there was significant use of a geographic adjective, be that ""China"", ""Chinese"", or ""Wuhan"". While this was not initially exclusive to conservative politicians or administration officials, in the last couple of weeks in response to many claims that the term is racist, offensive, and inaccurate, this language has become far less popular, and now is used in the US almost solely by Republican officials &amp; conservative media outlets, and has become far more frequently used by these individuals.

",51156,"Official infection and death numbers tend to rely on reports accumulated through several layers of bureaucracy, often with daily reports at several levels. A hospital reports the numbers to the city administration, they are added up and sent to the province, and those are added up and sent to the national level. So the actual reporting period is not the day when the statistic was published, it is when the base data was collected. That tends to be in the fine print, what news and spokespeople care about is the relative change from the previous reporting period.

You can find the tracker from Johns Hopkins which tends to exceed official national figures because they take local statements and add them up in realtime, rather than waiting for the official reports to arrive.

",Accepted,"The dominant American Foreign policy is some variation of ""The Monroe Doctrine"" which is best summed up as ""If you want to start trouble, you are not starting it here."" And the military has largely been set up to enforce this.  In the early days, this was quite easy as America really only had to maintain a small military force to counter European and Native American threats on the mainland, both were not to powerful... and if war broke out, reinforcements were difficult to get to the Americas before the US could increase its own forces.  The U.S. Civil war still remains the bloodiest war fought in the hemisphere with Gettysburg being the biggest battle in the hemisphere to date.

Up until the end of WWII, the United States had only ever participated in a war as a defender nation (or presumed defender when they made the declaration, such as the Spanish-American War).  The reigning political thought was ""It's not our problem unless they make it our problem.""  This changed with the cold war as Communism was deemed antithetical to the American ideals and had a mission statement of global communism.  The US invested heavily in preventing the spread, which was the goal of political Communist thinking.  Again, this isn't so much opposed to Monroe Doctrine as the goal was preventing Communism from reaching the Americas.  It's telling that the closest the U.S. ever got to declaring Nuclear War was when Russia started deploying Nukes to Cuba and the nation collectively lost its mind.

The US was able to ultimately win in while they had an irrational fear of the Communism, The Soviet Union had a very rational fear of the United States.  After all, they are the only nation to use a nuclear weapon in war.  And we didn't really hate the Japanese people's way of life when we were in that war.  But we hated Communism.

So the U.S. kept up military spending to scare off a Soviet Attack... and the Soviet Union tried to keep up with us.  (The Soviets never had the edge in the ""Bomber Gap"" and only briefly had it in the ""Missile Gap"" but they were much better at hiding this and had the U.S. convinced they had better missiles and more bombers than the U.S. did).  It became a game of chicken that eventually forced the Soviet Union into defeat as they couldn't keep up with U.S. spending, having been hit by several food shortages, the Afghanistan War, and Chernobyl.

This strategy has actually been able to protect the most important asset in the US military arsenal:  The Troops, very well.  In it's entire history which doesn't have a lack of war in it, The United States has lost about 2.7 million to casualties of War (Both wounded and unable to fight and killed) in its entire history.  Compare with the Soviet Union, which had lost about 2.9 million people to non-death related causalities in WWII alone.  By these numbers the United States is expected to lose an annual average 11,500 people to Death of War, which sounds like a lot, except that the average rate of deaths from civilian automobile accidents is around 40,000 per year in the US.

The U.S. Public wants to the military to do two things:  Keep the enemies ""over there"" where they belong and to send home as few of their troops in boxes as possible.  To do this, they are willing to put more money into the military than similarly developed nations.

As mentioned in comments, this has also meant that a large portion of the US economy is driven by the military.  In fact, it's not uncommon for entire communities to become Ghost Towns when the local military base is closed down for budget reasons.

McConnell indicated that he would try to pass the bill again on Monday, ostensibly so that Senators could see how markets would react to the lack of financial measures so far:


  We're going to vote at 9:45 in the morning (1345 GMT) ... 15 minutes
  after the markets open and see whether there's a change of heart,


This timing was not agreed to, with the debate continuing later in the day than planned, seemingly with no further bilateral progress made.

The first article also notes that Democrats ""decried the Republican proposal as prioritising the needs of Wall Street and corporate America over those of average people."", and would ""benefit corporate interests at the expense of hospitals, healthcare workers, cities and states"". Senator Elizabeth Warren, until recently a 2020 presidential candidate, told reporters that ""We're not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends"".

Which provisions in the bill specifically are opponents of the bill objecting to? Which measures are seen as benefiting corporate America over individuals?
",51162,"Democrats have been trying to make the case that the stimulus package contains within it a corporate ""slush fund"" controlled by the Treasury Department and headed by Steve Mnuchin, and Democrats believe there is a high risk of mismanagement or outright corruption. From NYMag:


  The central flash point concerns a $500 billion corporate bailout. [...] 
  Its requirements that bailed-out firms protect their workers are too weak. (Protecting the workers is the whole rationale for bailing them out, after all — at least from the Democrats’ point of view.) More disturbing, it’s designed as a pool of money to be doled out by the Treasury secretary. That is to say, the money is, for all intents and purposes, personally controlled by Donald Trump, who selected the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and could replace him on a whim. [...]
  One obvious outcome of this financing arrangement would be to create the all-but-certain outcome that the Treasury would select the Trump Organization as one of the worthy recipients of its largesse. Trump’s vacation properties have indeed been forced to shut down, and while an unbiased manager might not select the Trump Organization over needier coronavirus victims, Trump himself probably thinks differently. Indeed, at his press conference, the president did not even bring himself to deny that he might. “Let’s just see what happens,” he replied, as if the outcome might contain any mystery.


They also make the argument that the restrictions on the bailout fund that are in place to prevent some of the excesses by executives after the bailout of 2008 are weak, as are protections for workers who become unemployed. From Politico:


  According to a senior Democratic aide, the party's concerns with the GOP proposal center on $500 billion for corporations; stock buyback language that can be waived by the Treasury secretary; only a two-year time frame on executive compensation limits; and no provisions to protect individuals from eviction. [...] Democrats also object to what they say is an insufficient amount of money for state and local governments and providing only three months of unemployment insurance. Democrats initially asked for $750 billion in state aid, and Republicans have countered with far less.


A further complication for the bill is the behavior by many of these firms and how they chose to spend money saved by the GOP tax cut. Instead of using that money to create rainy day funds, they instead used that money to repurchase stock in order to inflate executive compensation to the detriment of their workers.

While McCarthy uses the term 'Chinese coronavirus', Rissuto's analysis also includes the term 'Wuhan Virus'. It should be noted however that this analysis was performed on all English language publications, not just US-targeted media, and has only collected data up until March 10th.

DFRLab conducted a series of queries using a media monitoring tool to test the claim that media organizations are acting hypocritically in this way, gathering information about how geographic adjectives were used by the media to describe the disease before the official name of ""COVID-19"" was applied by the WHO. This data is summarized in the chart below.


(Source: @MaxBRizzuto/DFRLab)

From this data, we can see that the terms 'Wuhan Virus' &amp; 'Wuhan Coronavirus' both had widespread use in English language media from the end of January up until the WHO named the disease on February 11th. The usage was comparable to the usage of the terms 'China Virus', and less commonly, 'Chinese Coronavirus'. After this date, we see the usage fall away dramatically, albeit not entirely, up until the recent debacle surrounding the use of geographic adjectives by various US and international politicians. This could also be due to the fact that as the virus spread throughout China, publications that would have used 'Wuhan Virus' found 'China Virus' to be more accurate.

In conclusion then, while a significant proportion of articles used the term 'Wuhan Virus' prior to naming conventions for the disease being established, after this point most media outlets switched to using the official terminology. The usage of the term has seen a resurgence in the media recently due in part to publications reporting on some politician's continued use of this terminology.
",Accepted,"Property does not tie directly to a particular person, nor is that mapping at all uniform for all members of society.  Police still need to get a search warrant to investigate the crime for several reasons, including:


Police could uncover evidence of other crimes, perhaps committed by other individuals living or associated with the deceased in some way.  That evidence would be inadmissible against the still living offenders without a proper search warrant.
Criminals, especially in violent crimes like this one typically are associated with their victims in some way.  For example, the suspect is believed to have killed his mother in this case.  An unwarranted search in this case could unnecessarily violate the rights of several of the victims as well.
The deceased is still only a suspect.  Again, in this very case the press originally identified the wrong person as the suspect.  It could yet turn out (however unlikely that may be) that the suspect was just another victim and without following the proper procedures, the real murderer may never come to justice.


It is often times frustrating to see these types of activities eat up valuable time in the pursuit of a criminal, but given the closeness with which we interact with other people and the seriousness with which we protect and value our privacy, it is important that our justice system operate blindly, even boringly, in its even handed pursuit of the truth.

some decisions can badly affect certain categories of people (lose jobs, unable to get access to care, difficulty in access food, for ex).


Old people are the most affected and in extreme situations.

Who is to say what is a ""bad"" decision? It's rarely obvious, even with 20/20 hindsight, and the general view is that the electorate is responsible for deciding, which means:
the redress for governments who make bad decisions is that at the next election the people will vote them out.


That said, a state of emergency does not mean ""anything goes"". Governments are still responsible for illegal actions. If a government ordered random shootings of innocent people in the street that would still be illegal, even in a state of emergency, and any soldier who carried out such an action could be prosecuted.

The vote was generally along party lines, with one exception: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voted against the cloture measure alongside the Democrats, despite arguing forcefully for the passage of the bill. I've noticed this with other bills and with Harry Reid before McConnell, so it's not just this bill – it seems like a more common pattern.

Why would the Senate Majority leader vote against cloture on a bill that they support? Is it a procedural issue?
",51187,"While looking for more examples of this process, I stumbled upon the answer.  

Why is Harry Reid always voting against his own plans?


  Forty U.S. senators voted to block a final vote on Chuck Hagel's nomination to be defense secretary. Of those, 39 were Republicans opposed to the nomination, at least for the moment. The other was Harry Reid. It wasn't that Reid opposed Hagel — far from it. ...
  
  So what gives? In articles like the one I wrote on the Hagel filibuster, the short explanation we give is that Reid voted no ""for procedural reasons"" or because a no vote ""allows him to bring another cloture vote in the future."" ...
  
  As Sarah Binder, a Senate rules expert at George Washington University, told me, it's not that the majority leader has to vote no. It's that somebody on the winning side of the cloture vote — in this case, the side voting against cloture — has to file a ""motion to reconsider"" if the matter is to be taken up again. ""I suppose the broader parliamentary principle here is that it would be somewhat unfair to give someone on the losing side of a question a second bite at the apple,"" Binder explains. So the rules provide for senators whose opinion has changed to motion for another vote, whereas those whose opinion stays the same don't get to keep filing to reconsider.
  
  Reid, and other majority leaders before him, have developed a clever workaround: Just change your vote at the last minute if it looks as though you're going to lose, then move to reconsider. In theory, any supporter of the bill or nomination in question could do the same, but traditionally it's been the majority leader.


Senate rules say that after a failed cloture vote (ie. the bill did not get the 60 votes needed to overrule a filibuster), a ""Motion to Reconsider"" (that is, a second attempt at cloture) can only be called by a member of the winning side of the vote.
",Accepted,"tl;dr> Correlation != Causation.

The difficulty in achieving any statistically relevant study is that you only have one data point - namely the expansion of all colonial empires correlated with the time period of the Mercator projection.  Thus, strictly speaking, you only have one degree of freedom in terms of data, constraining you to one exogenous variable.  That is simply insufficient to construct any type of model that has any residual explanatory power.  

Prior to the Mercator projection, you only had Ptolemy's Maps which were based on star sightings, and were accurate as far as latitude was concerned, but not longitude.  As such, there was no scientifically rigorous way of approximating land area in visual form.  For this reason, after Herschel's clock enabled longitude to be reckoned with precision for the first time, the King of France could decry the loss of 20% of his empire (which had been calculated based on approximations of longitude, rather than reality.) But, to ascribe to Ptomley the propagandistic effect of exaggerating longitude in order to enhance the Kingdom of France would be laughable, not least of the reasons of which are that Ptolemy's purpose was simply to arrange cities north to south and to make a best guess at east west relations.  

And, while Ptolemy had Erothanes' best guess as to the measure of the earth, there is not as much evidence that Mercator did, not that he particularly would have cared. Mercator's goal was to make the lives of the sea captians easier. 

The fact of the matter with regards to the Peters-Gall Projection, or any other projection for that matter, is that the creators of any map do have a point that a bias is inherent to the visualization. And indeed, Mark Monomer's How to Lie With Maps cites many persuasive pieces of propoganda that have been used throughout the years. But, to attribute a propagandistic motive to Mercator is an accusation after the fact.  As pointed out, Mercator's projection allowed for simple dead reckoning by sailors.  If it had an unintended propagandistic side effect, that is not documented nor is it statistically testable.

Thus to answer the question directly, yes, in fact, on 100% of the earth's using the Mercator Projection, it is correlated with a group of nations that were colonial empires in nature.  And, in 100% of the earth's prior to it, you also had colonial empires, such as Rome, China, the Maya and Aztec, the Indus, etc... Whether or not it is causative, however, lies beyond the realm of statistics to answer, because there is simply an insufficient number of earth's to reproduce the hypothesis.

51211,Is there a limit to how long the second round of French mayoral elections can be postponed?,"Coronavirus has forced the French government to postpone the second round of local elections:


  France will postpone the second round of mayoral elections to June 21 due to the coronavirus outbreak, two political sources told Reuters on Monday.
  
  Sources also said that the results of first round of local elections on Sunday would remain valid.


However, nobody really knows how long SARS-CoV-2 will be a major issue. Theoretically, the desired scenario implies mitigating the infections over a large period of time to allow the medical system to cope with the patients. 

I am wondering if the second round can be postponed indefinitely.

Question: Is there a limit to how long the second round of French mayoral elections can be postponed?
",51240,"There is no limit because there is also no provision for that. Article L56 of the code électoral even provides that:


  En cas de deuxième tour de scrutin, il y est procédé le dimanche suivant le premier tour.


In other words, any run-off has to take place the week after the first round of voting.

But, absent any constitutional provision to the contrary, anything and everything that is defined in a statute can in principle be undone by the parliament. Postponing the run-off at the last minute is a very ad hoc solution, not something that would be part of a well-defined procedure.

At this point, the government rescinded the décret calling the election and the parliament (both chambers) adopted a statute dealing with several issues arising from this (what to do with the results, etc.) In fact, that statute also extends the term of all town councils that haven't been replaced, as it could otherwise be deemed to expire.

It also provides that before setting a new date the government must publish the conclusions of its advisory scientific committee and that if it turns out to be impossible to organise the run-off in June then the election would be completely cancelled and the process should be restarted from scratch (new candidates, new ballots, new campaign, etc.)

Obviously, from a purely legal point of view, all these dispositions are also liable to be changed at any time should the parliament agree to do so.

what were the Republican objections to the counter-proposal?
",51236,"House Republican Whip Steve Scalise has given a press release which outlines the objections of Republicans to the bill, calling it a wishlist of ""insane far-left policies"". The objections in particular seem to relate to the amount of non-coronavirus related provisions within the bill. Republicans argue that these measures are unnecessary, and an abuse of the pressure currently on Congress to come up with a rescue package.

I won't reproduce the whole list of provisions that Scalise has picked out as objectionable, but they include environmental reform policies, an increase to the minimum wage, a law to force companies to disclose board of director diversity statistics, and a requirement that unions should have a seat on airline corporate boards. Many of these policies seem tangentially related, if at all, to the COVID-19 crisis.

These concerns have been echoed by other Republican groups, such as the Republican House Oversight Committee, who tweeted:


  Speaker Pelosi's #coronavirus bill includes: 
  
  
  Provisions for a federal takeover of elections
  A climate change study on aviation
  Intrusive corporate diversity reporting burdens

USA Today has published an opinion piece by James S. Robbins on the bill, which describes it as a ""Christmas in March for liberal special interests"". In particular, Robbins takes umbrage with the changes that would be made to elections:


  Perhaps the most troubling sections of the bill are under the rubric
  ‘‘American Coronavirus/COVID–19 Election Safety and Security” or
  ‘‘ACCESS” Act. This section would impose requirements on states for
  early voting, voting by mail, required mailing of absentee ballots to
  everyone, ballot harvesting (i.e., having third parties deliver
  absentee ballots), online voter registration, same-day registration
  and other practices which undermine confidence in the integrity of the
  ballot. In these days of increasing threats to election security we
  should be moving rapidly back to in-person paper ballots, but this
  bill would be a radical step in the wrong direction.

51252,Is it possible for a country to ask China for compensation over damage done by SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that most likely started in China?,"A part of this answer got me wondering if another state can request compensations over the huge economical cost of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics:


  (..) the region (HK, Singapore, SK?, China) was hit much harder during the 2003 SARS epidemic so spent more time getting prepared.
  
  (..) it has long been the expectation that the next epidemic would come out of China, both due to population density and proximity to livestock/wild animals, so those countries could expect another ""gift"" from their Chinese neighbors.


Theoretically it can be argued that China could have tackle ""the proximity to livestock/wild animals"" to avoid another pandemic. 

Is it possible for a country to ask for compensation over a pandemic started in another country. Or a pandemic is assimilated to a naturally occurring event regardless of context?

Question: Is it possible for a country to ask for compensation over damage done by SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that most likely started in China?
",51254,"First, let's address the biological point. China is not 'responsible' for this novel coronavirus or the pandemic it is generating. Viruses are constantly mutating, and all it takes to begin an epidemic is for one person to encounter one animal that has a mutated strain of a virus, a strain which can jump species and start transmitting itself human to human. Humans are social creatures; they will have social contact and pass the strain on to others. Of course, being in a densely packed region with exposure to livestock increases the odds of that kind of encounter and maximizes the rate of transmission — lots of people nearby to infect, so the disease doesn't have to work its way outward — but that is a condition of poverty as much as anything else. People living on marginal incomes will pack together and bring their livestock with them, because they cannot afford the luxuries of personal space or shipped-in food.

And frankly, while poverty exacerbates diseases, it does not create them. The next pandemic could just as easily start because some well-to-do American on his country estate gets shat on by an infected bird. Novel infections are a natural phenomenon. We are not immune to the workings of nature (despite our pretensions) so epidemics will happen on a rare but regular basis. Blaming a particular region for a pandemic is like blaming your neighbor because you got crabgrass in your lawn. Crabgrass doesn't know, or care, whose lawn it is.

This 'neighbor' example is a good analogy for the problem this question faces. Currently, all states are treated as sovereign, like a neighborhood of houses in which each homeowner has absolute say over what he gets to do with his house and yard. There is no overarching governance: no courts, no police, no administrators, no higher authority to appeal to, to force a neighbor to do this or that on his property. The UN is like a town hall in which people come together to argue and make resolutions, but it has no real teeth except as individual sovereigns agree to abide by its decisions. This leaves only a few options on the table:


Shrug and ignore what other sovereign homeowners do on their own turf, implicitly accepting the bad things that might float over the fence into one's own yard (i.e., the status quo).
Try to create agreements that commit all parties to certain kinds of behavior (i.e. pacts and treaties): a slow and difficult process to begin with, and one that any sovereign can back out of at any convenient-for-them time.
Restrict the ability of particular sovereign homeowners to interact with the community, in the hopes that deprivation will force them into compliance (i.e., sanctions, embargoes, etc.).
Create independent, unaligned groups that ask permission to enter another's sovereign territory to solve particular problems before they spread (i.e, NGO's and such). Note that sovereign homeowners are under no obligation to allow such groups access, and can interfere with such groups' work in any way they desire.
Force your way onto another's sovereign territory to solve the problem against that sovereign's will (i.e., war).


So long as we maintain the decrepit ideal of sovereign nations, there's not much we can do to prevent the spread of a disease through a nation and across its borders. There is nothing at all we can do to prevent the birth of a novel disease. And unless we are willing to address underlying social issues like poverty and overpopulation, we are as much to blame as anyone else for pandemics of this sort, so there is no point in trying to collect 'compensation' for some imagined wrongdoing we project onto others.

51265,What measures has Romania taken to contain the returning diaspora?,"News about Romania's COVID-19-driven, reverse diaspora:


  Over 200,000 Romanians who worked abroad have returned to the country since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, with many of them coming from those EU countries strongly affected by the pandemic, PM Ludovic Orban said on Friday [March 27].
  
  “On February 25 there was only one case in Romania, two cases of coronavirus in Spain, and several others in France. Look at the number of cases in Romania, less over 1,000, and if we also take into the account the cured ones, we have below 1,000 patients with COVID-19, while there are tens of thousands of infections in other countries. Romania has taken serious measures from the start”, the premier stated.
  
  Besides, he underlined that Romania had another particularity as against the other countries, namely that over 200,000 Romanians from Diaspora returned to the homeland. “If we had not taken severe containment measures, be it quarantine or isolation, the spread would have been larger”, Orban added.


How did Romania manage to quarantine 200,000 people returning from abroad (if I understand correctly that's what they did)? What specific enforcement measures did they take?
",51275,"I don't have a complete list of all the measures taken, but in large strokes, the following things happened:


schools were closed very soon after the first cases of covid-19 were discovered;
large gatherings of people were prohibited (not more than 100, then after some period not more than 50);
a state of emergency was declared when there were relatively few cases of infections compared to the population number;
a lot of local districts started to take actions on their own, like closing public parks.
the private sector also took action. Companies encouraged employees to work from home, sporting events were canceled, stores changed their program or limit the number of shoppers at any given time, hypermarkets started to disinfect their shopping carts and protect their cashiers with glass windows, trains in the subway station would pull only one by one at the platform to limit the number of passengers that would gather together.
because a state of emergency was declared, new laws were passed to control what people were doing. First there were restrictions to be on the streets between 22:00 and 06:00. This lasted for a few days, then restrictions were put in place all day. Now or example you are not allowed to exit the home unless for some specific reasons like buying food, seek medical help, take care of elderly people, go to work, and a few others. People above 65 are not allowed to go out of their home unless they have an emergency. For other activities they are only allowed to go out between 11:00 and 13:00. Stores reinforce this by allowing only the elderly to shop in that time interval. Now all parks are closed. And groups of more than 3 people are disallowed. All shops and malls that don't sell food or things you need to survive were closed.


These are a few things that happened since the whole covid-19 cases started to happen in Romania.

Now, to your question. Because we are in a state of emergency the law was changed to account for the pandemic situation. If you have returned from abroad you need to go into self-isolation or you are placed under quarantine (for 14 days if I remember correctly). You are not allowed to leave your house and friends, family or couriers must provide you with food and supplies. You don't interact with them, they just leave them at the door. If you do not respect these measures, the fines are now very large, up to 20000 RON (more than 4000 EUR), and you can also go to jail. If you breach self-isolation or quarantine and you are discovered, you are being placed under military guard so you don't do it again.

Now, with that being said, you can't really monitor 200000 people or keep them in check. There are controls, but you can't really keep them isolated. Many were discovered wondering the streets, going to parties, visiting friends, etc by the authorities. It helps I guess that there is some panic and people will report those that they know came from abroad and are not sitting put (mothers have reported their children to the authorities, for examples).

So basically that's what's happening right now. We have lower cases of infections than other countries because everyone reacted quickly and took measures before things were bad. Because movement is restricted this limits contact between persons. People also isolated themselves in the houses by precaution before the state of emergency was declared (for example, a few days before the state of emergency was declared, people hit the stores and bought all the flour and yeast, rice, canned produce, etc to stay in home for weeks) because of worry, fear, panic.

For further reference, some details on the infection in Romania:

https://instnsp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/5eced796595b4ee585bcdba03e30c127

(on the left, in red are the total confirmed cases, in yellow are persons under quarantine, blue is people in isolation at home, in gray are the number of deceased people)

My belief is that authorities panicked when they saw what was happening in Italy for example (many Romanians live there and return for Easter Holiday each year) so they took harsh measures before  it was needed. It seems it helped. Although they also took some bad decisions like limiting access to information (in the name of having it from official sources). I don't remember exactly, but I think that link above is from independently collected data, as authorities no longer report cases per district, but only globally.

EDIT: as a response to your comment I've looked up a few examples in the media:

1. In the first day of restrictions of circulation, 5,621 persons who did not comply with the measures were fined 7,404,297 RON (1,531,965 EUR). That's an average of 1,317 RON (272 EUR) per person.

2. In later news, the number of people who did not comply with the restrictions of circulation and were fined increased to 23,973, and an amount of 31,400,000 RON (6,496,730 EUR). That's an average of 1309 RON (270 EUR) per person. The same news mentions that for 209 persons a criminal record was opened and 4,235 were fined for non-compliance with the isolation/quarantine measures.

3. The news in point 2 did not mention how much the fines were for those that did not comply with isolation/quarantine, but in older news, 10 days ago, on the Ministry of Health's website it was stated that 1,835,000 RON (379,665 EUR) of fines were applied to 120 persons for not respecting the measure of isolation. That's an average of 15,291 RON (3,163 EUR) per person.

So the fines for breaking isolation/quarantine are quite large (plus getting a criminal record for more severe situations). For reference, the minimum net wage in Romania is 1,346 RON (278 EUR) while the average net wage is 3,189 RON (659 EUR). So for a large number of people, the fines are quite large.

The rest of the Treaty simply does not address the Church-State issue. It is basically a recognition of Italy of the Vatican as an independent country2. It is a State-State treaty. Other than allowing travel and residence rights to Vatican ""citizens"" and some minor points, there are no obligations beyond international laws.


Concordat

The Concordat is the true Church-State treaty. And it includes things like:


  Art. 5 No Ecclesiastic may be employed or remain in the employment of an office of the Italian State or any public entity depending from the same without the nihil obstat of the Diocesan ordinary.


So the Church says to the State if he can hire or not priests and the like...


  Art. 20. Bishops before taking possession of their dioceses shall take an oath of fidelity to the head of the State according to the following formula


Art. 34 says that the State recognizes the civil effects of Catholic marriage, and reserves to Catholic tribunals the right to cancel marriages. So (from my reading), no possibility of divorce; because if the Church does not cancel the marriage then the participants are still married in the civil dimension, too.


  Art. 36. Italy, considering the teaching of Christian doctrine according to the form received by Catholic tradition as the foundation and the crown of public instruction, agrees that religious instruction imparted in the public elementary schools shall have a further development in the secondary schools according to a programme to be established by an accord between the Holy See and the State.


Mandatory religious instruction.


  Art. 39. The Universities, the greater and lesser Seminaries, diocesan, inter-diocesan or regional, the academies, the colleges and other Catholic Institutes for Ecclesiastical formation and culture shall continue to depend solely from the Holy See without any interference on the part of the scholastic authority of the Kingdom.


Church control of universities.

The State also reserves some powers for itself (it can protest bishop nominations, bishops must be Italians, etc.)

So, it seems to be far from being a ""separation"". 

I would like to add that it could be argued that any concordat is by definition a breach of the separation of Church and State, since it imposes obligations on each of the parties to the benefit of the other. Of course, not all of the obligations are equally damaging.

51267,"How have US pro-life groups responded to Trump's COVID-19 crisis response, given that it could permit more deaths?","I would expect US pro-life groups to simultaneously support Trump (as they're typically right-leaning), yet simultaneously strongly against his death-permissive approach to bolster the economy during the COVID-19 crisis.


  WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.
  US President Donald Trump, via Twitter


Given that ""the problem"" includes large numbers of deaths, the US President is currently making a trade-off of human lives for the economy.  This seems to give rise to a conundrum for US pro-life groups.

Question: How have US pro-life groups responded to Trump's stance during the COVID-19 crisis, given that this stance could permit more deaths?

A National Review article seems to indicate pro-life groups are reconciling the deaths by arguing that a poor economy will also lead to deaths, but even Republican politicians are arguing that large numbers of dead people will hurt the economy:


  There will be no normally functioning economy if our hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands of Americans of all ages, including our doctors and nurses, lay dying because we have failed to do what’s necessary to stop the virus.
  Rep. Liz Cheney, via Twitter


So it's unclear to me how US pro-life groups can reconcile this.
",51271,"There's nothing to reconcile. Pro-life doesn't mean 'against (needless) death', it means anti-abortion. [The same is true for the opposite label: Pro-choice means in favor of legal access to abortion, not necessarily in favor of all individual choices (eg regarding assisted suicide or drug policies).]  

People supporting ""Pro-life"" can still support the death penalty, wars, restricted access to healthcare (for the poor), terrorist attacks against abortion providers, denial of healthcare to pregnant women even in case of a non-viable fetus, etc.

Response to the lax attitude regarding human life has been minimal, as that is not their issue; abortions are. The focus during this crisis by anti-abortion groups seems to be to further attack legal access to abortion. The SBA List coronavirus page or the Live Action news page eg focus on denying access to abortion &amp; defunding abortion providers during the crisis.

The few responses I was able to find are not from groups, but individuals, and seem to argue in the same direction as you mention: Relativizing the deaths by downplaying the risk &amp; impact and saying that a weak economy will also have a price. Eg:  


  economic hardship without a clear path to recovery imperils lives too (as evidence by a 300% spike in calls to the National Suicide Prevention Hotline); [...] targeted isolation of and care for the elderly is entirely possible while allowing the younger and healthier to go about their lives.


Others take a more utilitarian approach, weighing the ""lives saved"" due to denied access to abortion during the crisis vs deaths from coronavirus.

At least some individual people who hold anti-abortion views have opposed the economy > life view. The following quote is attributed to Rep. Cheney, though I was only able to find it by Erick Erickson:


  Letting the virus spread to your parents and grandparents to protect your 401k is not pro-life.


Russell Moore argues along the same lines in a NYT opinion piece, though without explicitly mentioning abortion or ""pro-life"".

52294,"Can the European Central Bank ""print money"" to partially mitigate the economical effects of the coronavirus infection spreading?","SARS-CoV-2 infection managed to bring a significant part of the economy to a halt and it is expected for lots of companies to have cash flows problems (e.g. impossible to pay the suppliers). I have recently saw a Romanian economist speaking about this issue and I was wondering how US and EU are dealing with this.

The European Central Bank decided to buy €750 billion worth of bonds while the US is considering printing more dollars (my emphasis).


  The extraordinary actions of the Federal Reserve on Monday morning can be boiled down to two sentences: There is a rapidly developing shortage of dollars across the economy. And the Fed will do anything it needs to, on any scale imaginable, to end this shortage.
  
  Its announcement was phrased in the dry bureaucratese typical of statements from a central bank. But it contains a powerful idea. The Fed, the one entity in the world with the power to create dollars out of thin air, has every intention of doing so at whatever magnitude is necessary to try to reduce the severity and limit the duration of the coronavirus economic crisis.


I am wondering why the Fed can print dollars while ECB cannot print Euros. Especially considering the ""desperate times"" of the new SARS.

Question: Can the European Central Bank ""print money"" to partially mitigate the economical effects of the coronavirus infection spreading?
",52297,"The Fed is the central bank of the United States, which is one nation despite the plural form in their name. 

The ECB is the central bank of some (but not all) EU nations, and their operation is based on an international treaty. What the ECB can and cannot do is spelled out in that treaty, and the member states could always modify the treaty if they consider that appropriate.


The ECB can effectively print money by buying Eurozone government debt. 
When the ECB was set up, the public in certain nations (notably Germany) was worried that the ECB would do that and tried to put safeguards into place.

  An indefinite and uncontrolled state of emergency cannot guarantee
  that the basic principles of democracy will be observed and that the
  emergency measures restricting fundamental human rights are strictly
  proportionate to the threat which they are supposed to counter.

Under the new legislation, by-elections are suspended and Orbán can rule by decree, suspend enforcement of laws, and arrest people for years under vague charges of ""publicizing distorted facts"" or ""violating quarantine"":


  The Hungarian parliament on Monday voted by a two-thirds majority to allow the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree without a set time limit.
  
  While the new legislation remains in place, no by-elections can be held and Orbán's government will be able to suspend the enforcement of certain laws.

  In Hungary, a new law has granted Prime Minister Viktor Orban the power to sidestep Parliament and suspend existing laws. Mr. Orban, who declared a state of emergency this month, now has the sole power to end the emergency. ...
  
  The law will permanently amend two articles of the criminal code that will further limit freedom of expression and penalize people for breaching quarantine orders. It will also suspend all elections and referendums.
  
  Under one measure, anyone who disseminates information that could hinder the government’s response to the epidemic could face up to five years in prison. The legislation gives broad latitude to the public prosecutor to determine what counts as distorted or false information.

The government can expand emergency declarations indefinitely without Parliamentary approval:


  The new law allows the government to make these extensions themselves indefinitely, or at least until Parliament decides to revoke this authorisation before the state of emergency is over


It gives the government vague and expansive powers to arrest people for ""false or distorting"" speech:


  The new law also introduces a vaguely worded new paragraph to the already existing offence of scaremongering in the Criminal Code, which opponents of the law say could threaten critical press:
  
  
    ""Anyone who, under a special legal order, in public, utters or spreads statements known to be false or statements distorting true facts shall be punishable by imprisonment between 1 to 5 years if done in a manner capable of hindering or derailing the effectiveness of the response effort.""
  


And it give them the power to suspend laws and cancel elections:


  The Coronavirus Act also introduces a number of other changes to the constitutional order of the country:
  
  
  The government will be allowed to take steps beyond the extraordinary measures listed in the Disaster Relief Act and suspend the application of certain laws by decree if necessary and proportional to protect citizens' health, life, property, rights, and to secure the stability of the economy in connection with the pandemic. ...
  No local or national elections or referendums can be held until the end of the state of emergency, elections and referendums already scheduled will take place after the special legal order ends.

The law is in sync with the indefinite and uncontrolled state of the virus and its progressing spread. The law grants no extraordinary powers outside the scope of the epidemic.

Regarding human rights and democracy
The law does extend the criminal code (BTK) 337. § (2) with regulations on spreading false statements, just like with The First Amendment the limitations on free speech are almost always specific to particular cases.

The law has been objected that elections are stalled until the end of the epidemic. Since no digital election system has been introduced as of yet it is a correct move to open the possibility to skip these public gatherings. The coming major elections are due in 2022, this law will very likely not impact that in any way.

The most important thing to point out is that this law just like the virus is temporary, and can be put to an end even before the end of the epidemic 3. § (2) by the government, so there is little the Secretary General could reasonably object.

In the US there also a significant shortage of toilet paper, which seem to be a supply and demand problem.  People want more than the available supply. 

Can the president increase toilet paper supplies?  
",52325,"President Trump was able to do that with ventilators because of the Defense Production Act:


  On March 18, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, President Trump issued an executive order that defined ventilators and protective equipment as ""essential to the national defense"", the standard required by the DPA.[17][18] Later that day, he indicated that he would not make immediate use of DPA authority, writing, ""Hopefully there will be no need""; he indicated that he would do so in a ""worst-case scenario"".[19][20] Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called upon Trump to ""immediately use the powers of the DPA to mass produce and coordinate distribution of"" critically needed hospital equipment such as ventilators, swabs, and personal protective equipment.[19][20] On March 20, Trump said that he will use the DPA.[21] General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra spoke to Trump administration officials about how GM could support production of ventilators.[22] On March 23, Trump issued an executive order classifying ""health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19"" as subject to the authority granted by DPA to prohibit hoarding and price gouging.[23][24] Trump's continued reluctance to use the act's authorities prompted further criticism.[25] On March 27, 2020, after negotiations with GM to produce ventilators had broken down over cost, which was being estimated at over $1 billion, but primarily due to GM’s uncertainty as to its ability to provide the number of ventilators required speedily, Trump ordered HHS Secretary Alex Azar to use the authority available under the DPA to require GM to accept and prioritize contracts for the number of ventilators that Azar determines to be appropriate.[26] Trump also named Peter Navarro national policy coordinator for the DPA.[27]


For Trump to do this for toilet paper, he would need to declare it vital to national defense. That seems kind of silly to me, but I recon he could do that. It has been done for ""aerospace structures"":


  In June 13, 2017, President Donald Trump invoked the law to classify as ""critical to national defense"" two sets of products.

As the AP reports (thanks to @Fizz for pointing this out), Defense Secretary Mark Esper has announced that the troops being withdrawn from Syria won't be coming home to the US: instead, they're going to Iraq to continue fighting ISIS:


  [Defense Secretary Mark] Esper’s earlier comments to reporters traveling with him were the first to specifically lay out where American troops will go as they shift from Syria and what the counter-IS fight could look like. Esper said he has spoken to his Iraqi counterpart about the plan to shift about 1,000 troops from Syria into western Iraq.
  
  Esper said the troops going into Iraq will have two missions: help defend Iraq and perform a counter-IS mission.
  
  Esper discusses keeping small US force in northeast Syria - The Associated Press


At the same time Trump announced that he was withdrawing 50 troops from Syria, he announced the deployment of 3000 additional troops to Saudi Arabia for potential use against Iran:


  WASHINGTON — The United States is sending about 3,000 additional troops to Saudi Arabia in the latest military response by the Trump administration after it accused Iran of attacks last month on Saudi oil facilities, the Pentagon said on Friday.
  
  The move came only five days after President Trump said that his desire to terminate America’s “endless wars” led to his decision to pull back from the border area between Syria and Turkey about 50 troops who were working to create a “safe zone” between Turkish and Kurdish troops.
  
  Trump Orders Troops and Weapons to Saudi Arabia in Message of Deterrence to Iran – The New York Times 


As of the end of October, it seems people's skepticism was well founded: as The New York Times reports, Trump has reversed course and is increasing the number of US troops in Syria, back up to a number near the original level:


  WASHINGTON — Every day in northeastern Syria, waves of American troops are pulling out under President Trump’s order this month that paved the way for a Turkish offensive that included assaults on the Pentagon’s allies, the Syrian Kurds.
  
  And at the same time, a separate wave of American troops from the opposite direction is pouring back in.
  
  In fact, once the comings and goings are done, the total number of United States forces in Syria is expected to be about 900 — close to the 1,000 troops on the ground when Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of American forces from the country.
  
  ...
  
  By Oct. 20, things were shifting again. Mr. Trump was talking about the need to protect the oil fields in eastern Syria. Pentagon officials began working on a plan to send additional American troops to guard oil fields.
  
  When combined with the troops at Al-Tanf, that brings the number of American troops projected to be in Syria to near 900, a number that could easily rise if, as expected, the Islamic State begins to make a comeback.
  
  Hundreds of U.S. Troops Leaving, and Also Arriving in, Syria - The New York Times, 10/31/2019


So, in the end this so-called ""withdrawal"" appears to be little more than a troop relocation.



And finally, even if US troops had been withdrawn from Syria, the initial plan was only to withdraw 50. The US expanded the withdrawal plan only after pressure from Turkey and Turkish-backed militias:


  Less than 48 hours before the withdrawal announcement, U.S. Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had given assurances that the troops would remain indefinitely, standing by their Kurdish partners to continue to hunt down the Islamic State.
  
  But the Turks’ capture Sunday of a key highway that served as the U.S. troops’ main supply line revealed the fragility of [their] mission
  
  The hasty U.S. pullback from Syria is a searing moment in America’s withdrawal from the Middle East  - The Washington Post 


In summary:


The troops aren't being withdrawn – they're just being moved to another war zone to continue the same mission
Instead of decreasing, the number of US troops in the Middle East has actually increased, and they've done so in a way that represents an escalation in tensions with Iran, thus making war more likely.
The so-called ""Withdrawal"" appears to have been little more than a troop relocation. As of November, the total number of US troops in Syria is little changed from the number that were there before the ""withdrawal""
Even if US troops had actually been withdrawn from Syria, many would question how much credit Trump should get, since that plan seemed to have been driven more by circumstances than any actual plan or desire to bring US troops home.

This is something I find surprising, since for the metrics I've been looking at, South Korea is doing better in every way:



It seems obvious that the 41% of people who think the US is doing as well as or better than South Korea are looking at different metrics than me, and I'd like to know what these other metrics are.

NB: I'm focusing on South Korea because although the original article also says the majority of Americans polled thinks the US outperforms China/Italy, there is a metric that I'm already aware of (total deaths, and in the case of Italy, total cases/deaths per capita) for which the US is doing better than those countries at the time of the poll, so if total deaths is what matters for most Americans then it's defensible to say the US is doing better. I'm not aware of any such metric for South Korea, however, which is why I'm asking.

Alternatively, what else can explain the US poll data?
",52341,"The key assumption you have made is assuming people in the US act sensibly, and that they would base their answer in the poll on facts. This assumption might not be accurate. A recent (Jan 2019) study shows that facts might not be too important in this matter [1].


  Inaccurate views of scientific consensus and the willful rejection of scientific consensus.
  In a 2014 US survey (15), two-thirds of respondents (67%) thought that scientists did “not have a clear understanding about the health effects of GM crops,” despite broad scientific consensus on the topic (16). Similarly, half of Americans (52%) thought scientists were “divided” in the belief that the universe was created in the Big Bang, and about a third each thought that scientists were divided on anthropogenic climate change (37%) and evolution (29%). Of course, these data do not make clear the cause of these inaccurate views, which, arguably, could stem from people being uninformed, intentionally misinformed, or a bit of both.
  
  Furthermore, split-ballot survey experiments have shown that even when Americans do seem to possess accurate knowledge of scientific consensus (however large or small that number may be for a given issue) there is no guarantee that they will integrate that knowledge into their attitudes or policy preferences (17). In other words, these respondents know what the scientific community has established as fact, but they nonetheless refuse to “know” it. Some have therefore argued that rejection of scientifically accurate accounts of the Big Bang or evolution by nonexpert audiences indicates neither a lack of information about scientific consensus nor the presence of misinformation, but, rather, motivated information processing (18). (Highlight mine).


Given that the current US government places little value on facts and that ""Make America Great Again"" was a slogan in the last election, I find it highly plausible that this is a factor here, too - that a certain amount of people simply want to believe that the US is the best in the world in everything, despite facts showing otherwise.

The study also finds:


  When such directional goals influence reasoning processes, individuals are prone to “biased assimilation,” which is characterized by confirmation and disconfirmation bias, or the parallel tendencies to privilege information that is consistent with one’s predispositions and to discredit information that seems contradictory (51). As with selective exposure, motivated reasoning can contribute to an individual becoming misinformed, and it can occur not only in political contexts but also when individuals process information about science and emerging technologies (52–54).


If you want to believe the US is #1 in everything, this seems to be a highly relevant point.

Also, emotional state can be an important factor. And I think we can agree that the current crisis is a very emotional matter, and that believing the US is doing better than anyone else might be reassuring, even if it isn't based on truth.


  The role of emotion.
  This brings us to discussions of the influence of affect in motivated reasoning processes. There is some evidence that a person’s emotional state can shape the accuracy of his or her beliefs. [...] Notably, individuals’ attraction to emotionally charged content is not limited to politics, and even when it comes to scientific discoveries, individuals are more inclined to spread information that has a greater emotional impact (59).


1: Scheufele, Dietram A, and Nicole M Krause. “Science audiences, misinformation, and fake news.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America vol. 116,16 (2019): 7662-7669. doi:10.1073/pnas.1805871115



So I think the answer is not that there are any objective metrics that show that the US is handling the crisis better in any way. The fatality rate is magnitudes higher (although it is too early to tell what the toll will be in the end), cases per capita are higher, total cases are higher, et cetera. I don't think there are those metrics that you are looking for. I rather think think it simply shows that a large percentage of the US population is either uninformed or misinformed, for various reasons as outlined above.



From the survey that was linked in the question, we can also see that the opinion on how the US is handling it relative to the rest of the world varies dramatically with the political orientation of the respondent, which would further back up that political orientation plays a significant role in how people perceive facts and responded.



The poll data for the question relative to South Korea is roughly in the same boat, polarization-wise. Only about 6% of Republicans say the US is doing worse than South Korea, whereas 45% of Democrats say that:


",Accepted,"After reading the attempts to quantify the veracity of the comparisons there is an easy answer that does not require putting people down or rationalizing cognitive dissonance.

The actual answer is what does the question mean from the perspective of those answering the question. What people actually think when answering this question: Has the handling of the crisis good for me? and secondarily: If I lived in South Korea would it be good for me?

Of course, if you look at it from the point of view of how the statistics work out, it is very unlikely you are personally directly affected by this particular crisis.  I'm not counting staying at home and losing your job, which is an indirect effect and most likely favored as a way of handling the crisis.

  Crimes against humanity are certain acts that are deliberately committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population or an identifiable part of a population.


For example, the Charter of the Nuremberg tribunal includes this definition:


  Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.


Condoning violence is not enough, you have to actually carry out one of these acts and systematically target an entire population or a specific group (like Jews for the Nazis).

",52377,"Expanding on the answer by Tin Nguyen, the Euro is a a common currency for nations with separate economic policies and separate national debts. Being a member of the Eurozone stops nations from devaluating their currency to compensate for changing economic fundamentals.

Before and during the 2007 financial crisis bonds from e.g. Greece or Italy had a risk premium compared to German bonds despite the fact that both were government bonds in the same currency. There were even signs that futures traders were driving this premium up by betting against certain governments, or on nations leaving the Eurozone. The famous ""whatever it takes"" speech by Draghi calmed that.

The financial consequences of the Corona pandemic are not yet known, but it is clear that Italy and Spain will be hit hard. That will increase the risk on a default on national debt which increases the interest which investors demand. Of course that further hinders economic recovery.

If the Eurozone members jointly guarantee bonds, that lowers the interest payments for the less stable economies and possibly increases the interest for the more stable ones. This might or might not be to the benefit of the EU as a whole and the stronger members individually (since they all benefit from a strong Eurozone), but the more or less clearly voiced suspicion is that Corona is used as an excuse to enact a permanent transfer mechanism.
",Accepted,"In this scenario, theoretically, the Vice-President of the previous administration should become President for the few minutes until 12 noon when the incoming President's term starts.



This is because:


Though the Vice-President of the new administration had already taken his oath of office, his term has not started constitutionally.


The Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution states:

  Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin.
  (emphasis mine)


The Constitution isn't clear if the Oath of Office is necessary for the President to take office. The text simply states:



  Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:—""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""

So, even though the incoming VP has already taken the oath for Vice-Presidency, his term hasn't started yet. And even though the outgoing VP hasn't taken the oath for the Presidency, he would become President for a few minutes until it reached 12 noon when the incoming President's term starts.

52389,Does the signing statement made by President Trump nullify the oversight provisions of the CARES Act?,"On March 27th, President Trump signed the COVID-19 stimulus bill, the CARES Act, into law. This came after days of debate, where Democratic lawmakers insisted on the inclusion of oversight measures before they would agree to pass the bill. A few hours after signing the act into law, the White House released a signing statement, where the President takes issue with several provisions in the bill, and states his administration's intent to treat some of these provisions as advisory or hortatory. 

Of particular interest is the following paragraph:


  Section 4018 of Division A of the Act establishes a new Special
  Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) within the Department
  of the Treasury to manage audits and investigations of loans and
  investments made by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Act. 
  Section 4018(e)(4)(B) of the Act authorizes the SIGPR to request
  information from other government agencies and requires the SIGPR to
  report to the Congress “without delay” any refusal of such a request
  that “in the judgment of the Special Inspector General” is
  unreasonable.  I do not understand, and my Administration will not
  treat, this provision as permitting the SIGPR to issue reports to the
  Congress without the presidential supervision required by the Take
  Care Clause, Article II, section 3.


This implies that the new position of Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) will be unable to perform their duties, as the President apparently reserves the right to supervise, and potentially suppress, any reports that the Special Inspector will attempt to make to Congress.

Is the President able to effectively nullify these provisions of the bill unilaterally, or does this signing statement have no legal weight until tested in the courts? Are any oversight mechanisms aside from this Special Investigator available to Congress?
",52397,"Signing statements do not have the force of law. Most often signing statements are used to signify how the President will interpret and enforce the law


  For example, in President Obama's signing statement for the [National Defense Authorization Act], he explained a few reasons why he chose to sign the bill (it authorizes funding for important national defense programs, etc.), then went on to point out a few sections of the bill that he viewed as unconstitutional. He then stated, ""My Administration will interpret them [some of the disputed sections] to avoid the constitutional conflict.""


In other words, signing statements are often just a different way to enact an Executive Order.

Going back to this bill, the relevant portion would be


  I do not understand, and my Administration will not treat, this provision as permitting the SIGPR to issue reports to the Congress without the presidential supervision required by the Take Care Clause, Article II, section 3.


This doesn't nullify the law, it simply says the SIGPR should not report to Congress without reporting to the President first. This does provide Trump with a preview of any report and a potential to influence the SIGPR, but there's no easy way to stop this since the SIGPR is part of the Executive Branch. Nowhere is Trump stating that the SIGPR is not to report to Congress at all (which would be a direct violation of the law).

52393,Why was there such a significant increase in firearms background checks in March 2020?,"According to statistics published by the FBI, March 2020 saw the highest ever number of NICS firearms background checks performed, at 3,740,688, an increase of 33% from February. The FBI itself notes that this does not equate to a one-to-one correlation to the number of gun sales that have taken place, but it is at least a rough indicator that the number of gun sales has also seen a large increase.

This trend held true in practically every state of the US, with the exception of Kentucky.

What are the political factors which have led to such a large increase? Clearly, as the main news story currently is the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems likely that this has had an effect, but it's unclear to me why this would lead to such a higher rate of gun background checks/purchases, especially as lockdowns start to reduce footfall at non-private sales locations.

It's become a joke how much people are hoarding toilet paper (in the US, in particular, it wasn't hard to find before this). But hoarding things is part of a broader issue (emphasis mine)


  Australia has also suffered from panic buying of toilet paper despite plentiful domestic supply. A risk expert in the country explained it this way: ""Stocking up on toilet paper is … a relatively cheap action, and people like to think that they are 'doing something' when they feel at risk.""
  
  This is an example of ""zero risk bias,"" in which people prefer to try to eliminate one type of possibly superficial risk entirely rather than do something that would reduce their total risk by a greater amount.
  
  Hoarding also makes people feel secure. This is especially relevant when the world is faced with a novel disease over which all of us have little or no control. However, we can control things like having enough toilet paper in case we are quarantined.


Guns still mean security to a lot of people

Guns are still a powerful way to protect oneself, and more than a few people fear social breakdown, despite the fact that no place in the US has suspended their police force due to the pandemic, nor are there widespread shortages of police. As such, people want weapons to stop intruders


  Hyatt said that the type of guns being bought was reflective of the fear prevalent among customers. There was almost no interest in hunting rifles. Instead, people were opting for target guns and there was big demand for AR-15 semi-automatic assault-style rifles.
  
  Asked why he thought the spike was happening, Hyatt replied: ""Financial meltdown, pandemic, crime, politics … you throw it all into the pot, and you have one hell of a mess.""

I wonder how the governor and mayor of US most affected US state &amp; city, that is NYC (and NY state) are doing in the opinion polls lately.
",52417,"Both of them, but particularly Cuomo, have received exceptionally high marks. 

According to a Siena poll posted on March 30th with data collected 3/22 - 3/26, approval of Cuomo’s pandemic response is 87-11, including 70% approval from Republicans! DeBlasio’s is lower, but still quite good at 61-31 approval to disapproval. 



The above figures are specifically about how well they've done to address the pandemic, but Cuomo’s overall approval has also improved by 54 points to a near record high of 71-23.

  Forty-five percent of Americans say they have a favorable view of how New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is responding to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released exclusively to The Hill.
  
  Harvard CAPS/Harris polling director Mark Penn told The Hill. ""No question he is seen now as a leader at least with Democrats and not seen as partisan since he is favorable right now by 2 to 1.""
  
  Cuomo favorability in US hits 45 percent: poll


If we take Penn at is word, that would mean that his approval is 45%, disapproval is ~ 22% and no opinion is 33%. While 45% doesn't sound that high, I'd argue that it's surprising for that many people nationwide to have a positive opinion of a local politician from another state.
",Accepted,"No

As a general rule, libertarianism is opposed to changes imposed by majority rule over the objections of a minority.  The more likely solution in this case would be for the nine homeowners to buy out the tenth.  

Note that it is also possible that the ten homeowners could have previously entered into a contractual relationship where the tenth homeowner would be obligated to comply with majority rule.  But that's based on freedom of contract, not majority rule as a principle.  

The best time to establish such a system is before selling the home to the person who has different values.  In a libertarian system, it is far more likely that people who favor restrictive rules would try to get that institutionalized prior to forming the community.  People wouldn't expect to be able to make such changes later, so they'd want the system to be clear up front.

",Accepted,"The obvious answer is the General George Washington needed a flag to differentiate his forces from the English forces. It is speculated by historians that the flag was simply created by sewing white stripes on an English Ensign.  The design was simply expedient and similarity to the East India Company is circumstantial.

What is difficult to understand this many years removed from the events is the state of the world at the time.  The idea of a federal central government had not been realized at the time or was so new that it was not at the top of everyone's mind include the General. What I mean is every colony has its own flag which was more important to the average man. With so many symbols, picking something to represent the union was almost an after thought.

The evidence of course is not compelling, but we can speculate by the fact that the so called ""Grand Union Flag"" (So called because it was named that many decades later, it may have been called ""The Continental Color"" by contemporaries) was used to represent both land and sea forces. A practice that was not traditional at the time (There was a country flag, an ensign for ships, a battle flag, a regimental flag, etc.).  Actually there is an analog in modern times. While the flag of the country is the same as that flown on military bases, on ships and used on some military uniforms, there is a flag of sorts on military air forces. For example, the US has a circled star flanked by three strips on each side.  Any way, the continental congress used the flag and then quickly (for the day) discarded it and designed a more permanent design (so that is from around the end of 1775 to June 14 1777).

  Mr Hancock - who recently ended his seven days of self-isolation after contracting the virus - said: ""We cannot relax our discipline now. If we do, people will die.

The Telegraph headlined their youtube video of that press conference with

So a reasonable-enough interpretation seems to be that it's not a relaxation of the prior government stance. I don't know if some left-wing press has tried to spin this into something else.

",Accepted,"Who gets to ask?

In the Stack Exchange (SE) system, the person asking determines the accepted answer.  That's not a big problem if one person is the clear beneficiary.  But what about systems where multiple people benefit?  Who asks would determine who gets to accept an answer.  

Subject to corruption

There are regular concerns about people banding together with friends to influence the system in Stack Exchange.  This hardly ever happens.  Why not?  Mostly because the results of being the highest voted or accepted answer don't matter much.  If your answer is accepted over mine, it may bruise my ego, but it doesn't actually matter.  I don't make less money or have to do more work as a result.  

In your system, the outcome would matter.  As a result, all those worries about people banding together to control the outcome become justified.  Tactical voting would become rampant.  Closing questions so that you can ask your own question and control the acceptance criteria would be useful.  

Who's the dictator?

Many aspects of Stack Exchange are controlled democratically.  But in the end, the Stack Exchange system is a dictatorship, not a democracy.  Stack Exchange can reverse votes (e.g. if you go around down-voting a single person for disagreeing with you) and delete questions and answers (e.g. spam).  

This works for Stack Exchange for two reasons.  First, they are a relatively benevolent, hands-off dictator.  We rarely feel the tyranny because they are careful about using it.  Second, because Stack Exchange is optional.  If I decide that they are abusing their power, I can start a new site called Queue Swap tomorrow that does the same thing.  If most people agree with me about the abuse of power, I'm likely to get lots of people joining me.  That possibility keeps them honest.  

Your system would not be optional.  So we'd have to have some way of controlling the ""dictator"" in the system.  But in the end, that just gets us back to something mostly like the current system.  An empowered executive who can make the real decisions.  A frustrated minority grumbling under those decisions with which they disagree.  

Who determines urgency?


  every important decision is taken based firstly on its ranked urgency


Who determines whether a decision is important or urgent?  This isn't unsolvable, but the Stack Exchange system does not generally solve it.  Meta decisions tend to be non-binding, although some people will choose to follow them.  The real decisions about the importance and urgency of changes on Stack Exchange tend to be made by the benevolent dictator.  

What happens if the dictator disagrees with you?  For example, Obama finds Zika to be important and finds terrorism to be less important.  

Free markets as Stack Exchange

Note that a free market economy gives many of the same results as you are trying to get from your Stack Exchange system.  Most decisions are made by individuals.  Multiple answers (products) can receive up-votes (purchases).  Your individual decision controls your personal environment, much the way that acceptance controls your question in Stack Exchange.  High reputation (wealthy) users have additional moderation powers.  Yet you don't seem satisfied with this system and want to change it.  

Effecting change

As you may gather, I don't favor this change.  That said, the question of how to make change is certainly answerable.  You need to find supporters and take control of the mechanism for making changes in your country.  

To use the United States as an example, this would require either two-thirds of Congress or sufficient support in state legislatures to call a constitutional convention.  If a convention, you'd have to make sure that they voted for your amendment.  Then you need to ratify the amendment with the approval votes of the legislatures in three-quarters of the states (thirty-eight or more).  Note that the last time we had a constitutional convention, we ended up with a new constitution instead of simply amending the old one.  

This is the age old method for making changes.  It's not fast.  In the US, Republicans as a party were in favor of women's suffrage in 1860 but did not actually pass it until 1920.

  An analysis here of smartphone location data by the U.S. search engine giant showed that visits to shops, parks or railway stations fell steeply in most European countries between Feb. 16 and March 29 as governments sought to slow the explosive spread of the COVID-19 disease.
  
  In Italy and Spain, which have imposed near-total lockdowns on public life, retail and recreational trips were down by 94%. The two Mediterranean countries, along with France, saw the sharpest drops in people passing through transportation hubs like railway or metro stations. Visits to workplaces were down by more than 60% in Italy and Spain, in an indication that their lockdowns may turn out to be the most economically disruptive.
  
  To the north, Sweden has by contrast sought to minimise disruption to social and economic life while its caseload remains low. Visits to restaurants, shopping centres and cinemas, for example, have declined by just 24%. Numbers going to grocery markets and pharmacies have fallen by 10%, while trips to the park are actually up by 43% as people head out to enjoy the Scandinavian spring. Going out for a walk or a jog is up in Denmark, Estonia and Finland too.
  
  The number of people spending more time in residential areas is up by 5% in Sweden, whereas in Italy and Spain it has increased by 24% and 22% respectively as people are confined to their homes.
  
  In Britain, which moved relatively late to restrict people-to-people contacts, the impact has been less severe than in southern Europe. Retail and recreation visits are down by 85%, public transport by 75% and time spent in workplaces by 55%.
  
  Germany, which has the third-highest caseload but a relatively low number of fatalities thanks to widespread early testing for COVID-19, has taken a less radical approach with the number of people visiting workplaces down by 39%, the data show.


Are there such (comparative) statistics available for US states? E.g. did these numbers fall in NY (which was hardest hit by the pandemic) more than elsewhere in the US?
",52462,"Yes, Google has published these statistics at a per-state level for the United States. 

To use the example in your question of New York, compared with a state with far fewer COVID-19 cases currently, such as West Virginia, we can see that New York has seen large reductions in mobility trends across every category except Residential, while West Virginia has relatively smaller reductions, and in fact a large increase in mobility trends for parks. 

This seems to be similar across the board, with the statistics for Nebraska, with a similar number of cases as West Virginia also showing smaller reductions in most categories, a smaller increase in Residential mobility trends, and a whopping 109% increase in mobility trends to parks. New Jersey, however, another state which has been fairly badly hit, sees a large reduction in the statistics across the board.

At a first glance, then, this would seem to support your theory that these numbers fell more significantly within states that have been hardest hit by the pandemic so far, meaning that social distancing measures are being complied with and taken more seriously in these states. Further analysis would need to be performed on the full data set, including the range of social distancing regulations and enforcement levels in the individual states in order to draw full conclusions.

Google themselves state in their reports that ""Location accuracy and the understanding of categorized places varies from region to region, so we don’t recommend using this data to compare changes between countries, or between regions with different characteristics (e.g. rural versus urban areas).""

In that case: Proponents of unrestrained capitalism don't have ""protecting things"" as part of their ideology. 

The point is that ""the market"" will take care of it. Landmarks would be privatized and whoever owns them would do with it as they please. If they want to preserve it for the sake of it, then they'd do that. If they want to preserve it and charge tourists for access, then they'd do that. 

And if they want to demolish it and built something more profitable, that would be fine too. If others want to prevent it, they'd have to try to raise funds to buy it (if the owner is willing to sell). If they can't do that, then the market has spoken. The landmark doesn't add enough value to society for people to be willing to finance it, so it should be demolished.

52461,How overcrowded are NY parks? Have they been deemed dangerously so from a public health perspective during this Covid-19 outbreak?,"According to a NY Post article, parks in New York have become so overcrowded during this Covid-19 outbreak (supposedly because residents can't find anywhere else to go, e.g. restaurants are closed), so much so that some use cemeteries as parks in the hope of finding a less crowded spot. How accurate are these journalistic impressions? Is there data on the increase in overcrowding in NY parks during this outbreak, and if so, have there been any public health estimates on the danger that these park crowds may cause?

(I see that Cuomo was incensed by the crowded parks, but that was more than a week ago. He did close playgrounds, in the meantime.)

To those who think this can't be but BS (per comments below), governor Cuomo and mayor de Blasio have disagreed often enough, e.g. The Atlantic relates their disagreement on school closures:


  De Blasio angered New York parents and some of his own allies by resisting for days a decision to close schools, acting only following pressure from Cuomo and after a near-revolt by advisers and top public-health officials. “He’s both a bad decision maker and not good at communicating about it,” said an elected New York Democrat and former ally of the mayor’s, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve a working relationship with the de Blasio administration.


So I wouldn't be surprised they disagreed about parks too. The question whether the parks are crowded obviously has a public-health and thus a political dimension too nowadays (so I disagree with those who think this is off topic.)

And if you need anther source, the March 23 story was covered by Bloomberg too, with a March 20 image:




  Tired of being cooped up at home, hordes of New Yorkers headed to Central Park and other open spaces in the city over the weekend -- and that’s making Governor Andrew Cuomo very irritated.
  
  “It’s insensitive, it’s arrogant, it’s self-destructive, it’s disrespectful to other people, and it has to stop, and it has to stop now,” he said. “This is not a joke, and I am not kidding.”
  
  Calling the crowds “wholly inappropriate” amid a statewide stay-home order, he’s now asking the city to develop a plan that he can approve Monday to correct that.
  
  “We talk about social distancing,” he said. “I was in these parks, and you would not know that anything was going on.”


I don't know how [un]reliable ""The Gothamist"" is, but they posted these images supposedly from March 27:




Of course, a lot can change in a couple of weeks in people's attitudes, even if the parks are still open. And likewise some photos may be unrepresentative. The question is: did any behavioral change happen that made the closures unnecessary, or was Cuomo ranting like a madman and there was no problem to begin with?

It hasn't been uncommon to drive by a lake access point and see hundreds of people tightly gathered by the loading ramps.

Then again India started to construct Farakka barrage in 1961 and again the construction slipped into desuetude because of Pakistan's threat. Finally, Farakka was opened in 1975 on a trial basis (after the independence of Bangladesh in 1971). But, since then it was never taken down.
River water sharing: India has built dams/barrages on each international river upstream of Bangladesh. Tista river water sharing agreement is kept dangling for years now.
Border killing: Indian BSF has been killing Bangladeshi cattle-dealer citizens on a regular basis. Several years ago BSF killed an 15-year old girl named Falani Khatun and kept her body hanging on the barbed border-fence which received widespread international media attention.
Illegal immigrant propaganda: India says that Bangladeshi citizens cross the border and living in the Indian province of Assam illegally. Given the socio-economic scenario, this is an absurd propaganda. Muslims are living in Assam from the period of Mir Jumla II. During British Raj, Lord Curzon tried to create a new province named East Bengal by making Dhaka the capital as Dhaka was the center of Muslim culture and trade  which has failed to take shape because of widespread protest from Kolkata-centric Hindu elites. Assam was part of that proposed province. After the partition of India, native Assamese (Hindu and indigenous population) started to try to drive Muslims out of Assam. Very recently, when the BJP came to power, this drive is intensified.
Job seekers: It is believed that there are nearly a million Indians are employed in Bangladesh's service and manufacturing sectors who are straining a nearly saturated job market. 
Muslim lynching and Cattle vigilantism: In recent years, Muslim lynching because of eating/trading beef, and cattle vigilantism in India attracted widespread media coverage in Bangladesh.
Backing of Myanmar government: for the last few months, this has been a very prominent issue. Indian government rejected a UN proposal for the repatriation of Rohingyas and is supplying arms to Myanmar government. As a result, Bangladesh has become totally bogged down in Rohingya crisis.

Peter Altmaier gave an interview to the tabloid newspaper Bild am Sonntag. In this interview, he talked about US sanctions and tariffs in general and also in specific -- notably against the EU, China, Iran, and also Turkey.
He mentioned that as secretary for economic affairs he represents 7,000 German companies doing business in Turkey, and that ""we want Turkey to be a stable and democratic country."" He also said that Turkey knew ""we do not compromise in the protection of German citizens.""
There have been other EU leaders who emphasized that ""a strong Turkish economy is in the EU interest"".

52494,"Are any countries besides China planning to use ""Fangcang"" hospitals to relocate those infected/suspected of Covid-19, but who have a mild illness?","Somewhat controversially, China has had temporarily relocated those infected with Covid-19 in the Wuhan area to so-called Fangcang hospitals, large communal areas transformed into make-shift hospitals. Although there were up to 13 Fangcang hospitals opened at one point in Wuhan, these were apparently all closed by March 10.


  Fangcang shelter hospitals may seem similar to the makeshift and emergency field hospitals used during previous epidemics in other countries, for example, in the USA during the 1918–19 influenza pandemic, or in African countries during the 2014–15 Ebola epidemic. However, they differ in several important ways. First, the Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were established to isolate the patients who were most likely to transmit the infection because they had only mild to moderate COVID-19 and were thus likely to be active in their daily lives and in contact with family and community members. Second, the Fangcang shelter hospitals served an important triage function, separating patients by severity of symptoms, which was not a focus of previous makeshift and emergency field hospitals. [...]


These Fangcang hospitals should not be confused with the other kind of emergency hospitals that China had built earlier, for those more seriously sick with Covid-19, such as the Huoshenshan Hospital. (The latter was a prefab hospital with separate rooms.)

I've heard that some countries are already considering converting open-space structures to some kind of emergency/extra hospitals, e.g. as seen in this US footage. While the open-space conversion resembles more a Fangcang than the other type of prefab Chinese hospital, what do know about plans to mass-quarantine the mild cases in such open-space-conversion hospitals elsewhere, i.e. do (any of) these resemble Fangcangs in (intended) function, not just in looks?
",52501,"Yes, several countries are planning to implement this approach, and in some cases, already have. On March 12th, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), an EU agency, updated its rapid risk assessment on the COVID-19 pandemic, in which it advises states to 


  designate treatment facilities both for mild and for severe COVID-19 cases with critical care capabilities (e.g. ECMO). This
  implies activation of hospital plans to the highest level to be able to cancel elective diagnostic and operative procedures and
  re-assign human resources, creating temporary treatment facilities for the mild cases or advising self-isolation until
  symptoms improve or worsen.


The WHO also released guidance to this effect on March 17th, reiterating that 


  WHO recommends that all laboratory confirmed cases be isolated and
  cared for in a health care facility.
  
  [...]
  
  If all mild cases cannot be isolated in health facilities, then those
  with mild illness and no risk factors may need to be isolated in
  non-traditional facilities, such as repurposed hotels, stadiums or
  gymnasiums where they can remain until their symptoms resolve and
  laboratory tests for COVID-19 virus are negative.


In Madrid, this advice was implemented with a temporary hospital set up in the IFEMA conference centre. The first patients arrived at the facility on March 21st, and initially had a capacity for 200 patients with 'mild' cases of COVID-19. Capacity will eventually be extended to 1300 beds, with a small number of ICU units in case these mild cases progress to severe cases.

Hotel Vía Castellana has also been converted (article in Spanish) to a temporary hospital for mild cases, with six of the hospital's floors converted to facilities for the lightly ill, and a seventh converted to house medical staff.

In South Korea, this strategy has also been used - the WSJ reports that in order to solve the issue of hospital overcrowding:


  South Korea divided confirmed patients into four categories. Only the
  sickest and elderly went to hospitals. The young and asymptomatic went
  to dormitories, which were lent by Samsung Life Insurance Co., LG
  Display Co. and others, equipped with little more than beds, Wi-Fi and
  the occasional television.
  
  The decision ensured that low-risk individuals remained quarantined
  under government watch. Thousands of South Korea’s virus patients have
  ridden out the past several weeks living in buildings where companies
  typically put up workers for off-site, multiday training.


In the Phillipines, ""Emergency Quarantine Facilities"" (EQFs) are being planned, temporary centres designed for ""patients who are waiting for test results or have mild symptoms but aren’t in dire straits — a way to keep potentially infected people separate from their communities.""

Many countries, however, have chosen not to adopt this strategy, instead advising those with mild to moderate symptoms to self-isolate, prioritising hospital beds, including field hospital beds, for those most at risk or with the worst symptoms. In Singapore, the country had enough hospital capacity to deal with all patients, including those with mild symptoms, due in part to the amount of testing and contact tracing which was used to isolate and quarantine cases.
",Accepted,"Oligarchy is rule by a powerful few. Its not inherent to the term how they became powerful or whether they make good or bad decisions. 

Cronyism is a term for politicians who give wealth and power to their political supporters. These supporters can be a small group of oligarchs who in turn call the shots and rule the nation.

The supporters could also be a large group. For example, many see politicians who support unbreakable tenure and increasing wages for under performing teachers as cronies of teachers unions. Teachers union cronies, however, are not supporting oligarchs because there are a large number of teachers in society. Other large groups often labeled cronies of politicians include realators , sailors, bureaucrats, and farmers. All of these groups benefit from government action, but none are concentrated or powerful enough to be considered oligarchs.

52537,Why did Wisconsin Republicans oppose postponing the April 7th election despite COVID-19 shutting down nearly all polling places?,"After last minute, party-line decisions by the US and Wisconsin Supreme Courts, Wisconsin will hold their presidential primary and a hotly-contested Supreme Court election tomorrow (April 7th) despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The state's Democratic governor has been pushing to delay the election and/or extend the window for absentee ballot collection, but the Republican controlled legislature have opposed both moves. 

In addition to the the potential for voters to get infected while voting, the vast majority of polling sites have been closed due to a lack of volunteers (most of whom are usually retirees) to run them:


  The state has faced serious questions about its ability to run an election amid the pandemic. With poll workers quitting out of fears of contracting the virus, more than 100 municipalities have said they lack enough staff to run even one polling place.
  
  Milwaukee typically has about 180 sites; this election the city plans to have five open. The head of the state elections commission raised the possibility in court testimony that some voters may have to head to a different town on Election Day because no one will be staffing the polls in their hometowns.
  
  Wisconsin Is Set to Vote on Tuesday After Court Overrules Governor’s Postponement - The New York Times


Why is the state Republican party insisting on going forward with an election where most people will be unable to vote, even if they're willing to risk their lives and health to do so? Even if they don't consider the threat of COVID-19 to be significant, the closure of so many polling places guarantees that people will be denied the opportunity to vote.
",52566,"Rural voters aren't afraid to go to the polls to keep a conservative state supreme court justice in power.

The April 2020 ballot does include the U.S. presidential primary, but that will have little effect on state politics.  After I first posted this answer, the New York Times echoed many of the points I make below, starting with:


  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders are on the ballot in Wisconsin, but the main event is the State Supreme Court race between the conservative incumbent justice, Daniel Kelly, and a liberal challenger, Jill Karofsky.


Wisconsin has an elected state supreme court that currently has 5 conservatives and 2 liberals.  One of the conservatives (Daniel Kelly) is up for election in April 2020, and the another conservative is up in the next election after that (Pat Rogensack, 2023).  If liberals win both of those seats back, they would have a 4-3 majority and could undo the laws that keep the minority Republican party in power.


  The election determined the size of the court's conservative majority. A win for Karofsky would have reduced the conservative majority to 4-3, meaning that the next regularly scheduled election in 2023 would decide control of the court. A Kelly win would have preserved the court's 5-2 conservative majority.
  
  Ballotpedia


It's helpful to understand the political context:


For decades prior to 2010, Wisconsin was a moderate state.  The legislature and governorship each frequently flipped between the Democratic and Republican parties.  Since 1900, Wisconsin has equally chosen Republicans and Democrats for President.
Justices on the state supreme court are elected and technically nonpartisan.  Nonetheless, their conservative versus liberal ideology are often clear.  For decades prior to 2010, the state supreme court held a liberal majority.
It's worth mentioning that long ago, Wisconsin Republicans were leaders in open elections and progressive ideas.  The Republican party started in Wisconsin, as an anti-slavery party (later to be re-started in Michigan).  The word ""progressive"" was coined by Republican Robert La Follette.  Wisconsin was the first or among the first states to adopt women's suffrage, open ballots, primary elections, recall elections, referenda, outlawing child labor, worker's compensation, and income taxes; all were progressive Republican measures.  Prior to the Tea Party, the state was considered one of the most bipartisan and least corrupt states.
Led primarily by Tea Party candidates, in the fall 2010 election, Wisconsin Republicans won control of all three branches of government.  This included the election of Scott Walker as governor, a one-seat majority in the state senate, a considerable margin in the state assembly, and a 4 to 3 majority in the state supreme court.
Republicans quickly enacted a series of laws that would lock in their party's control:


Using sophisticated computer models to draw election maps for the U.S. House, state senate, and state assembly to maximize Republican seats and to pack Democratic votes into few districts.  The gerrymandering is so successful that in the 2018 elections, Republicans won 5 of 8 U.S. House seats with only 45.61% of votes, and 63 of 99 state assembly seats with only 44.75% of votes.
Adopting a voter-ID law.  Minorities and the poor -- who tend to vote for Democrats -- are less likely to have the proper types of identification.
Purged 234,000 voters from voting rolls.
Requiring early voting to be performed only at the municipal clerk's office, and not multiple sites.  Thus the 600,000 residents of Milwaukee (a Democratic stronghold) had only one site for early voting, the same as a town of 600 people would.  This law was struck down by a federal judge in 2016.


  
  A requirement that cities can have only one place for early voting. Critics have said large cities such as Milwaukee should be able to have multiple voting sites because not everyone can get downtown easily.
  

Limiting the days and hours for early and absentee voting.
Replacing the agency which oversees elections, from the Government Accountability Board composed of judges chosen by other judges, to the Wisconsin Election Commission chosen by politicians.
Moving the state supreme court elections from the fall (which have high Democratic turnout) to the spring (which have poor Democratic turnout).  This has been particularly effective at increasing the conservative control of the court, from 3-4 in 2010 to 7-2 in 2020.  Note how the election during the pandemic is a spring election, with a supreme court contest.
Holding special elections to fill vacancies on unusual dates -- when Republicans turn out -- instead of the usual fall and spring election dates when Democrats turn out.
After a series of failed recall elections for the governor and Republicans in the state senate, changes that made recalls more difficult (2015 Act 117).
A series of laws (most famously 2011 Act 10) to cripple the power and finances of labor unions, which are the primary backers of Democratic candidates.
In 2015, changing the Chief Justice position from the most senior justice (a liberal) to being chosen by a majority of the court (conservatives).
In 2015, stripping the powers of the Democratic secretary of state.
Increasing the powers of the Republican governor and attorney general.  When Democrats won back these offices in 2018, the powers of those offices were reduced in a lame duck session.

The conservatives controlling the state supreme court have upheld most of the laws described above.  This includes laws that affected the justices' own re-election.  In particular, the decision specifically about whether to continue the election during the pandemic went along ideological lines.
Moderate Republicans were treated poorly by the dominant Tea Party faction.  The previous Republican leaders of the legislature -- Dave Schultz in the assembly and Mike Ellis in the senate -- were pushed out of leadership by Tea Party leaders.  Schultz would later testify in a gerrymandering case that Republicans were brought one-by-one to a law office, and were ordered to vote for the gerrymandered maps, else their own districts would be gerrymandered to make them lose.  In the ensuing years, many moderate Republicans quit the party in disgust, and many moderate office-holders were voted out in primaries by Tea Party candidates.  The loss of moderates had drained the support of the Republican party.
Since 2010, Democrats have been gaining ground.  By number of voters statewide, the Republican party is actually a minority party in Wisconsin.  Wisconsin's top Republican even admitted that they aren't the majority:


  After the Republican Robin Vos, the speaker of the Wisconsin Statehouse, said that “if you took Madison and Milwaukee out of the state election formula, we would have a clear majority.""


However, the measures described above are so effective that the state supreme court and both houses of the state legislature still remain in Republican control.
Democrats swept every statewide office in 2018: U.S. Senate, governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, and treasurer.  They had more votes in the U.S. House, but because of gerrymandering, they won only 3 of 8 seats.  They also had more votes in the state assembly and gained one seat, but again because of gerrymandering, they did not gain control.
As has happened nationwide, the Wisconsin Republican party has aligned with rural interests and and the Democratic party with urban interests.  COVID-19 is likely to keep people in high-density (i.e. Democratic) districts at home.  Like other rural places in the U.S., rural Wisconsinites believe that COVID-19 is a ""big city"" phenomenon and are likely to show up to the polls.  Per the New York Times, about one of the least populous counties:


  Bruce Johnson, the Democratic chairman in Pepin County, along the state’s western border with Minnesota, said he pushed for absentee balloting but people were less concerned because they rarely wait in lines to vote.


Wikipedia:


  When the election went ahead on 7 April, access to easy in-person voting heavily depended on where voters were located. In smaller or more rural communities, which tend to be whiter and vote Republican, few issues were reported.


It's therefore in the interest of Republicans to keep the election going during the pandemic.
Should liberals take back the state supreme court, they can overturn the system of laws which keeps the Republican party in power.  They would then be at the mercy of the voters, who have been increasingly voting Democratic.

The US is unlikely to take any action against any significant country unless it can definitively prove that link.  But there are some countries that this might make a great justification for military action.

52553,What political and social factors underlie Sweden's controversial response to COVID-19?,"Sweden has adopted a far less radical set of policies in reaction to COVID-19 than most other European states. Many other European states are in ""lock-down"", with severe restrictions on people's free movement, with people being advised to only leave their homes for food/medicine. In Sweden, by contrast, people are largely carrying on with their normal lives.


  While every other country in Europe has been ordered into ever more stringent coronavirus lockdown, Sweden has remained the exception. Schools for pupils up to 16 years, kindergartens, bars, restaurants, ski resorts, sports clubs, hairdressers: all remain open, weeks after everything closed down in next door Denmark and Norway.
  
  As the rest of Europe lives under lockdown, Sweden keeps calm and carries on - The Guardian, March 28, 2020


What social and political factors underlie this decision, and why is it so dramatically different to other European countries response?
",52555,"The reason for Sweden's rather hands-off approach compared to other European countries was summed up rather well by lead epidemiologist of the Public Health Agency of Sweden, Anders Tegnell, who said in an interview with CNBC:


  My view is that basically all European countries are trying to do the
  same thing — we’re trying to slow down the spread as much as possible
  to keep healthcare and society working ... and we have shown some
  different methods to slow down the spread, [...] Sweden has gone
  mostly for voluntary measures because that’s how we’re used to
  working, and we have a long tradition that it works rather well.


This tradition of 'laissez-faire-ism' that Tegnell talks about was explored by Johan Norberg in his 2013 essay How Laissez-Faire Made Sweden Rich. This is quite long but well worth a read. Notably, Norberg argues that rather than Sweden's economic and social successes being a result of the SAP ""managing to tax, spend, and regulate Sweden into a more equitable distribution of wealth—without hurting its productive capacity"", Sweden's greatest successes both economically and socially ""took place when Sweden had a laissez-faire economy"".

Sweden's approach to the current pandemic, then, would seem to be influenced by the political traditions of its past. I should note that although Tegnell is hopeful that the current strategy will be successful, he doesn't rule out the implementation of more stringent measures should the data suggest that the laissez-faire tactics are not working.

As far as social factors that have influenced Sweden's response go, one such factor is how sparsely spread its population is. This article from Our World in Data notes how Sweden consistently ranks near the top of metrics related to single-occupant households, and the country also ranks 50th out of 54th for Population Density amongst other European countries.

It is likely that another factor has been the reluctance of the government to negatively affect the economy more than is required. For example, although taking a hands-off approach with regard to restricting personal liberties, it has taken a far more active role in ensuring the continued functioning of business, and on March 27th announced that it will guarantee 70% of bank loans provided to companies that are experiencing financial difficulty as a result of the pandemic.

In conclusion, Sweden's response so far seems to be a combination of the reluctance of Swedes to accept restrictions on personal liberty - note the outcry by opposition parties when a proposal to rule by decree was announced, a tradition of past laissez-faire approaches, and distinct social factors that will potentially help provide a natural defence against the virus.

Why did the Senate use this bill instead of creating a new one? What happened to the original? Since the Senate replaced it's text, can it no longer fulfill it's original purpose?
",52583,"The reason for amending this bill instead of the Senate creating a new bill was to fulfil the requirements of Article I, Section 7, Clause 1 of the Constitution, also known as the Origination or Revenue clause, which states that all bills for raising revenue must originate within the House of Representatives. Note that despite the Senate seemingly being able to dictate the content of the bill, the House still has to approve the amendment.

The Senate has decided that it is legitimate to fulfil the letter of this clause, if arguably not the spirit, by replacing the entire text of a bill originating in the House with a bill for raising revenue. The constitutionality of this decision has been examined by Rebecca M. Kysar in her 2013 paper The 'Shell Bill' Game: Avoidance and The Origination Clause. In Chapter II, subsection C2, she notes that while the Supreme Court has never ruled on this, several state courts and lower federal courts have condoned this interpretation.

The original bill is now one and the same as the CARES Act, and you are correct in saying that it can no longer fill its original purpose, as the original wording has been completely removed and replaced by the Senate amendment.

Have any countries so far announced that they would abolish (or significantly relax) restrictions on drug/vaccine development for the duration of the pandemic?
",52596,"China has also fast-tracked their own vaccine development, with testing in humans (news of March 18):


  CanSino Bio and its collaborators at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences’ Institute of Biotechnology secured a quick Chinese regulatory go-ahead to start human testing of their recombinant coronavirus vaccine, the company said in a disclosure (PDF) to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Wednesday. [...]
  
  The green light was doled out very quickly. It was only Tuesday when CanSino said it had filed the pre-IND review application for the vaccine to authorities and was in the process of a rolling submission of technical documents. [...]
  
  Meanwhile, amid growing numbers of infections in the U.S., the FDA has allowed a phase 1 study of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine without animal data. On Monday, the biotech said researchers at the National Institutes of Health dosed the first subject. [...]
  
  Besides CanSino and Moderna, many other companies are also working on vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. [...]


I cannot tell you how much ""bending of the rules"" this is in China, since I'm not familiar with their regulations.  But the timing of the Chinese announcement was roughly two days later after the US announced the first Moderna vaccine dose having been injected into a human (on March 16). Interestingly perhaps, China is also developing a mRNA vaccine ""jointly developed by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Tongji University and Stermina in Shanghai"", but this one is still undergoing animal testing in China, with human testing announced to begin mid-April.

So yeah, the US (NIAID/Moderna) and China (CanSino) are now basically in a ""race for the [vaccine] cure"". Others will probably join. I suspect they might also benefit from regulatory fast-tracks, possibly depending how well politically connected they are in their test jurisdictions. (The EU has given Curevac a grant to work on a mRNA vaccine similar to the Moderna one; however no human tests have begun with that--they've been announced for June. The WHO said that over 40 concrete vaccine candidates have been proposed, with at least a hundred in development.)

Interestingly, on Jan 17, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) put out a rapid report saying that: 


  The occurrence of a few cases having no history of contact with the implicated market
  or other any similar market suggests the possibility of the infection source being more widely distributed, or of human-to-human transmission similar to other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The occurrence of a few family clusters also supports this latter hypothesis. However, there is currently no knowledge on the transmission mode or risk factors for transmission. Furthermore, there is no information on the disease spectrum or risk factors for severity. In light of these unknowns, we cannot exclude the possibility of low-level virus circulation in the Wuhan community and thus the possibility of other clusters occurring in the near future.

  There is a high likelihood of case importation in countries with the greatest volume of people travelling to and from Wuhan (i.e. countries in Asia).
  There is a low likelihood of importation of cases in EU/EEA countries, due to the less extensive traffic of people with Wuhan. 
  


For comparison, what did the US CDC say on this matter (human-to-human transmission) within this period (i.e between Jan 14 and 21), and did they also asses back then (like the ECDC did) the likelihood of importation into the US?



Insofar I was able to find, by Jan 31, the US CDC was clearly convinced of human-to-human transmission:


  On January 31, 2020, CDC published updated PUI guidance (8) in response to the evolving global epidemiology of 2019-nCoV, including the rapid geographic expansion and documentation of person-to-person transmission (9). Updated guidance emphasizes 2019-nCoV testing for symptomatic persons in close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, persons returning from Hubei province in addition to Wuhan City, and persons from mainland China requiring hospitalization because of fever and lower respiratory tract illness. Additional refinements to this approach likely will be needed in the future as understanding of 2019-nCoV epidemiology continues to improve.


But what did they say roughly two weeks earlier, before the WHO had confirmed human-to-human transmission?
",52613,"On January 17th, the CDC announced that COVID-19 screening would begin at ""three U.S. airports that receive most of the travelers from Wuhan, China: San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Los Angeles (LAX) airports.""

They also state in this press release that:


  CDC is actively monitoring this situation for pertinent information
  about the source of outbreak, and risk for further spread through
  person-to-person or animal-to-person transmission. CDC may adjust
  screening procedures and other response activities as this outbreak
  investigation continues and more is learned about the newly emerging
  virus. Entry screening alone is not a guarantee against the possible
  importation of this new virus but is an important public health tool
  during periods of uncertainty and part of a multilayered government
  response strategy. As new information emerges, CDC will reassess entry
  screening measures and could scale activities up or down accordingly.


This indicates that an assessment of the likelihood of importation of the virus into the US was completed, and a decision was made that only the airports with the largest amount of traffic needed to be screened. They do however note that this is not a guarantee that the virus will not be imported. Further on in the briefing, they mention that:


  China health officials report that most of the patients infected with
  2019-nCoV have had exposure to a large market where live animals were
  present, suggesting this is a novel virus that has jumped the species
  barrier to infect people. Chinese authorities additionally report that
  several hundred health care workers caring for outbreak patients are
  being monitored and no spread of this virus from patients to health
  care workers has been seen. They report no sustained spread of this
  virus in the community, however there are indications that some
  limited person-to-person spread may have occurred. CDC is responding
  to this outbreak out of an abundance of caution, ready to detect
  people infected with 2019-CoV.


This briefing suggests that while the CDC was preparing for human-to-human transmission to be confirmed, and may have even thought that this was likely, it did not have the data to confirm this.

Later on, on the 21st, the CDC released another briefing after the first COVID-19 positive patient was identified in the US. The briefing notes that the patient returned from China on the 15th, before the screening mentioned above was implemented. This release, however also does not state that human-to-human transmission is confirmed, but mentions that


  While originally thought to be spreading from animal-to-person, there
  are growing indications that limited person-to-person spread is
  happening. It’s unclear how easily this virus is spreading between
  people.


At this point the CDC also implemented screening at two more airports, Atlanta and Chicago.

It seems clear, therefore, that the CDC did not have access to data which confirmed human-to-human transmission, although the steps taken to implement health screening at airports, and the advice given to healthcare providers on January 8th indicates that it certainly thought that the likelihood of this was great. Clearly the health screening also proves that spread from Wuhan was seen as a possibility, although we can infer from the fact that this was initially only set up at three airports that this was either not seen as a large possibility, or that the spread via air-travel was not expected to be high enough to warrant a complete lock-down.

",52617,"India is a large producer of Hydroxychloroquine because, prior to the promotion of the drug as a potential treatment for COVID-19, its most widespread use was as an anti-malarial drug. India has, according to the WHO's World malaria report 2019, the largest proportion of malaria cases outside of Africa:


  Nineteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa and India carried almost
  85% of the global malaria burden.


The report also notes that India is the only one of the ""high burden to high impact"" countries (basically countries most affected by malaria) to have significant domestic investment into dealing with the disease compared to the reliance on international aid. This has manifested itself in the form of pharmaceutical manufacturers which can supply India with its domestic demand for the drug, such as Zydus Cadila and Ipca Laboratories.

This Forbes article notes that these companies in particular have significant capacity to ramp up production:


  “The priority is to manufacture this drug versus anything else,” says
  Sharvil Patel, managing director at Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila,
  which had $1.9 billion in revenues in fiscal 2019. “We have ramped up
  our production of hydroxychloroquine from 3 metric tons per month to
  20 to 30 metric tons per month and can scale it up further to 40 to 50
  metric tons if there is a requirement.”
  
  Ipca Labs, which has 20-metric-ton capacity, can produce 100 million
  tablets a month. “The Indian government has placed a significant
  order,” says Ajit Kumar Jain, joint managing director of Ipca Labs.
  “We can increase our manufacturing capacity to 26 metric tons in a
  month or two. We are also simultaneously ramping up our packing and
  labelling lines.”
  
  [...]
  
  Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical
  Alliance, an industry group, says that “the domestic demand is 3
  million tablets a month but we have the capacity to go up to 150
  million to 200 million tablets a month easily.” He adds that “it is
  very difficult to predict demand going forward because we do not know
  how many will be affected.”


This is, of course, on top of the underlying fact that India is, according to Raconteur, the largest provider of generic drugs globally, with its pharmaceutical industry is growing by 7 to 8 per cent a year, with growth of 11 to 13 percent expected in 2020.

It seems that India's prominence in the manufacture of the drug is due to existing infrastructure due to high existing domestic demand, and a strong underlying pharmaceutical industry, giving it the ability to quickly scale up production levels.

Yesterday, April 8th, the station broadcast an interview with David Icke, the same conspiracy theorist who claimed that a link between 5G and the COVID-19 pandemic exists in a live broadcast on Youtube which caused Youtube to alter its policies on removing COVID-19 misinformation. 

In this latest broadcast, Icke reportedly accused Israel of ""using coronavirus to test its technology"". The Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, said:


  You are absolutely right these are lunatic conspiracy theories and no

  it broadcast conspiracy theories about coronavirus.
  
  Uckfield FM was forced to apologise after a programme featured a guest
  presented to listeners as a health professional, but who made claims
  Covid-19 was linked to the rollout of 5G.


Being forced to apologise doesn't seem like that harsh a punishment personally, and with a quick search, I couldn't see whether Ofcom has any sanction powers beyond this. What powers does Ofcom have to impose sanctions, and what form can these sanctions take?

Directions may include ""broadcast an apology / correction / statement"".

Generally the maximum fine for commercial radio is £250,000 or 5% the broadcaster's 'qualifying revenue', whichever is the greater. There is a settlement process providing for discounts.

Revocation of the licence would make it unlawful for the broadcaster to broadcast in the UK.

",Accepted,"I am not sure the decomposition between ""traditional"" and ""jihadi"" is the best one. I would rather say quietist, political activists (rather recent if you exclude holy war partisans), and holy war partisans.

Salafism is quite well summed up in the wikipedia page :


  The Salafi movement or Salafist movement or Salafism is an ultra-conservative reform branch or movement within Sunni Islam that developed in Arabia in the first half of the 18th century against a background of European colonialism. It advocated a return to the traditions of the ""devout ancestors"" (the salaf).


So far, it means you dress, pray, eat, live, ... according to the sacred sunni texts (quran &amp; sunni hadith), with the salafs as role models. 

However, these salafs wanted to establish an islamic state, and even fought wars for it. What to do about it ? What to do about the current government, assuming you already have freedom of religion * ?

First option: don't care. This is what salafi quietism means. This movements considers that mere mortals would be unable to establish an islamic state, so they shouldn't try to do it. It can also mean to wait for the mahdi, the person in charge of establishing an islamic state before the final judgement (who may be a ""reincarnation"" of the prophet, I am not sure about that, I confess that religion uses words without enough clarity behind them for me).

Second option: care. It can mean to engage in politics, like what some salafists did after the egyptian relovution. They got engaged in politics separately from the already in place islamist parties. In Tunisia, some founded the party Jahbat al islah. Or, it can also mean wage a holy war, what is usually called ""jihadi salafism"".

Note that there is an ambiguity with the term ""jihad"", since some people are calling to reform its meaning. There is none with the term ""holy war"" or with the activities of the list of groups mentioned in the wikipedia article for ""salafi jihadi"".

As for ""who are they"" like in a list of names and their locations, I think a lot of governments would like to know this...

 On Mar 18, CARES Act came into force and  will pay out $2 trillion USD.
On Apr  8  the Federal Reserve released minutes from meeting where it took rates to zero because of coronavirus


  Miller said he expects the Fed balance sheet, currently just shy of $6 trillion, to expand to $10 trillion or more.


On Apr 9, the Federal Reserve will print $2.3 trillion USD to buy junk bonds and lend to states in a new wave of stimulus.

My questions


Why did Congress need the CARES Act? Why didn't it just recommend that the Federal Reserve spend $2T USD, which looks  way easier? I know that the Federal Reserve is autonomous and Congress can't order the Federal Reserve to do anything.
Similarly, Senate Democrats block $250 billion in small business relief, accuse McConnell of a ""political stunt"" : politics. Why didn't Congress Members just recommend the Fed spend another $250B,?
As you can see from the points above, both sides criticized and haggled before enacting the CARES Act. But the Federal Reserve has spent way more than $2.250T! Isn't this a contradiction? Why haven't Congress Members criticized or haggled the Federal Reserve like Democrats and Republicans are criticizing each other in Congress? 
Doesn't the CARES Act prove that the Fed isn't spending, or hasn't spent, enough money on the the right people?  If the Fed was giving money to the right people, then would the US need the CARES Act? 

",52626,"Broadly speaking, the Fed can only keep markets liquid by doing things like buying assets or making loans to banks against assets owned by the banks.  That's awesome if you're worried that mortgage-backed securities are tanking in value and the Fed can come along and prop up their value until the panic is over.  That's a concern today but it was a much bigger concern back in 2008 when the housing bubble burst. 
 It is useless if your goal is to get money into the hands of people or small businesses that need it to pay rent or pay their mortgages today.  If Congress wants to get money to those folks, it has to pass legislation to spend the money.

Fed spending is also very different from Congressional spending because the Fed is generally buying (or lending against) assets, it's not generating spending that drives demand.  Most of the Fed's $1.5 T involves going to banks that have some assets and saying ""Hey, nice assets.  We'd love to give you a cheap loan if you put those assets up as collateral.""  That ensures that banks have plenty of money on hand to be able to lend out and ensures that there is a willing buyer for whatever assets the Fed is lending against.  Eventually, though, banks are going to give the Fed back that $1.5 T with a small bit of interest.

50518,Is there an official assessment of the side-effects of a quarantine for COVID-19 in US or in China?,"Given the lack of critical assessment in the US media of China's massive quarantine, I think that there are many people in the US who would view it acceptable to shut down a major American city to prevent the spreading of an outbreak.  However, I worry that no one is considering the consequences of such action.  

With major parts of the economy no longer functioning, people would have difficulty with things like finding child care.  This has trickle down effects, such as pharmacy staff staying at home with their children.  This may lead to lethal consequences.  

Examples of trickle down effects:


Cancer survivors can't access health care (this is currently happening in China). 
Lack of access to medicine.  This can be deadly to people with severe chronic conditions (e.g. heart disease).
Lack of social support (e.g. no one is checking in on Grandma).


Question: 

Do policy makers (in either China or the US) consider the unintended consequences of large quarantines?  If so whose advising them and studying those effects?  Is the decision to quarantine based off of a process or is it based off of an executive leader's 'intuition'.  

My 'intuition' is that these unintentional effects may be killing more people than covid 19.

There is also a large academic community of public health specialists that study problems like this. See for example these academic papers:

  We address the issue of whether, why and under what conditions,

  the benefits of quarantine and isolation justify some level of

  measures.


The Challenge Of Mandatory Evacuation: Providing For And Deciding For


  Insufficient attention has been given to the ethical and legal
  questions surrounding mandatory evacuation in disasters and
  emergencies. We argue that mandatory evacuation orders entail a
  governmental duty both to provide for people and to decide for people:
  Government must trigger the provision of critical resources as well as
  vigorous and persistent efforts to persuade reluctant citizens to
  leave.


Of course the political powers might choose to not to follow the advice of their professional staff or outside professionals, but that comes with grave political risks if the situation goes south. The political powers might also receive contradictory advice from different groups of professionals. Which experts should they listen to?

There is also the chance that even with the best of intentions and the best available information, the experts will make the wrong call, or apply the ""lessons of the last battle"" in the wrong situation. 

These are hard questions. For example, in In August 2005 Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and over 1800 people were killed. The governments of Louisiana and New Orleans we broadly criticized for not fully evacuating the city. Later in 2005 Hurricane Rita was projected to hit Houston and a mandatory evacuation was ordered. Dozens of people died in the evacuation of Houston, from heat stroke, accidents, and a tragic bus fire. As it turned out, Hurricane Rita struck Houston only a passing blow, and fewer people died in the storm than in the evacuation. New lesson learned: don't evacuate, shelter in place, evacuate only those most at risk. Then in 2017 Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, causing massive flooding, and requiring the rescue of thousands of people trapped in floodwaters. And afterwards everyone was asking Why Didn't Houston Evacuate?.

Predicting the future is hard.

50597,How would next U.S. President be determined if there was a national emergency that significantly disrupted voting in many states?,"This sort of builds up on this and this previous question. Both of them ask about if the President can block the transfer of their office to a successor.

In response to the current Coronavirus pandemic, many states are encouraging people to use “social distancing” methods and canceling large public events to prevent the spread of the disease. With large numbers of people using the same voting booths and voting machines, in-person voting seems like it could provide an effective vector for the spread of the disease, and if the pandemic continues to get worse it’s possible to imagine in-person voting being significantly disrupted.

In this situation, what would happen if the coronavirus (or another pandemic) significantly disrupted in-person voting for the Presidential election? Would the election be delayed, or are there mechanisms to enforce a change in voting methods? In this kind of hypothetical situation, how would the successor of the U.S. President be (s)elected?
",50614,"First, this has never really happened in the United States. In extreme emergencies and national disasters, elections have been held a few days late, but never suspended (unlike, for example, the United Kingdom, that suspended elections during World War II). Elections were also not canceled during the Civil War, or as a result of the War of 1812 (during which the U.S. capitol was burned to the ground by foreign military forces).

For example, elections were not prevented from being conducted by the Spanish flu of 1918 which was in all respects deadlier and more contagious than the coronavirus, despite the fact that the technology available for a response in 1918 was less advanced.

Realistically, you would need a disease that is catastrophic on the scale of the Black Plague in medieval Europe (that killed a third to a half of the population in many places), and not merely something like the coronavirus (with a 2% mortality rate), to take out the electoral process in the U.S.

A situation like that would involve the collapse of the entire regime and government, and would send us into uncharted waters.

Second, election laws can be changed quite quickly in an emergency. One could, for example, shift as Colorado has, to a system of near complete all mail in ballots, to reduce the amount of in person interactions that were needed.

The U.S. Constitution does not provide the option of not conducting an election. In the absence of an election, elected offices become vacant and the succession provisions of the law which usually kick in when there is a death during someone's term of office would kick in. U.S. Senate vacancies can be filled in most states by Governors on a temporary basis. U.S. House seats that go vacant must be filled in vacancy elections. There is a line of succession to the Presidency defined by law involving a few key Congressional leaders and the cabinet.

  increase in adults showing up with kids that are not a family unit,”
  she said. “Those are traffickers, those are smugglers, that is MS-13,
  those are criminals, those are abusers.”
  
  A DHS representative provided The Washington Post with the hard
  numbers behind Nielsen’s statistic. There were 46 cases of fraud —
  “individuals using minors to pose as fake family units” — in fiscal
  2017, the period from October 2016 through September 2017. In the

  In fiscal year 2016, HSI initiated 1,029 investigations with a nexus
  to human trafficking and recorded 1,952 arrests, 1,176 indictments,
  and 631 convictions; 435 victims were identified and assisted.


and Border arrests exceed 50,000 for third month in a row.

The most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics data as to human trafficking is for 2015 Federal Prosecution of Human-Trafcking Cases, 2015, where the total number was reported to be 1,923 total persons referred for human trafficking prosecution


  In fscal year 2015, 1,923 suspects were referred to U.S. attorneys
  with human trafcking as the lead charge—39% for peonage, slavery,
  forced labor or sex trafcking; 32% for production of child
  pornography; and 29% for transportation for illegal sex activity. This
  was a 41% increase from the 1,360 suspects referred to U.S. attorneys
  in 2011.


It is important to note the conflicting reports that have been issued as to the subject matter of human trafficking, see 2018 NCVRW Resource Guide: Human Trafficking Fact Sheet


  In FY 2016, DOJ initiated 241 federal human trafficking prosecutions
  and charged 531 defendants. Of these prosecutions, nearly 95% were
  predominantly related to sex trafficking. DOJ also secured convictions
  against 439 traffickers in FY 2016. Of those convicted, 97% were
  primarily involved in sex trafficking.


and the disclaimer of the data held within the report


  Human trafficking is difficult to measure. Fear of harm to self or
  others, language barriers, lack of personal freedom, and fear of law
  enforcement often prevent victims from reporting their victimization
  or seeking services. Additionally, multiple agencies are charged with
  investigating and prosecuting human trafficking cases, at both the
  federal and state level, and providing services to victims. The
  record-keeping systems across these agencies may not allow for
  cross-referencing, and some victims may appear in the records of
  multiple agencies. Because of this, human trafficking reports should
  not be used to make generalizations about the scale or scope of human
  trafficking in the United States.


where ""human trafficking"" can be divided into at least several categories including ""labor trafficking"" and ""sex trafficking"". 

It is not clear if the question attempts to distinguish between sex trafficking, labor trafficking, or human trafficking without any forced attached sex or labor after the ""victim"" or ""illegal immigrant"", depending on the perspective is successfully trafficked into the United States; for example, a family paying a trafficker to get them to the U.S. without being forced into sex or labor, or if the premise is that all human trafficking involves forced sex and labor.

What is clear is that the total prosecutions for human trafficking arrests at the border is a substantially low percentage of the total ""border arrests"".

According to Southwest Border Migration FY2018 a total of 145393 persons have been apprehended between April 2018 and June 2018. Correlating the total number of individuals charged with human trafficking for the entire year of 2018 to the publication date of the Washington Post article How to mislead with statistics, DHS Secretary Nielsen edition, we have 191.

Thus, the math is 

(191 / 145393) * 100 = 0.13136808512101683

50942,How much do the Italian and Chinese COVID-19 lock-down measures resemble each other?,"I have the impression that Italy has adopted some if not all the ""Chinese playbook"" on COVID-19, including a large scale lock-down. That may well be justified given that the number of new cases appears to be declining in China, something that the WHO has labelled ""impressive"".

What I want to ask though: is there a more detailed ""checklist"" of measures contrasting how Italy and China's responses to the virus compare? E.g., what precise activities were restricted.
",51066,"I can give some information about the Italian lockdown. Source: the FAQ from the Italian ministry of internal affairs.

What you can do


go to work (any kind EDIT: on March 21, as an additional restriction, ""non-essential"" businesses were stopped). Telecommuting / remote working is recommended when possible.
travel for work (for instance, plumbers can go visit their clients).
commute between different cities for work reasons.
go visit the shops that are still open: food, pharmacy/chemists, newspaper's agents, tobacconists, bars and restaurants on motorways, some grocery and personal item shops, hardware stores, laundries... While doing so, customers must be at a distance of 1 m one from the other.
in particular, you can get out to buy newspapers.
return to your main residence (wherever you are).
go tend to elderly relatives.
divorced parents can go visit their children.
dispose of trash.
walk your dog (EDIT: in some regions, this was further restricted: one cannot go further than 200m from one's house for this reason), or take it to the vet for urgent matters.
go running or practicing (individual) sports (EDIT: in some regions, this was further restricted: one cannot go further than 200m from one's house for this reason).
use a bike for an authorized purpose (e.g., as a sport, or to commute).
there is no limitation to the number, length, or frequency of outside trips, as long as they are all for authorized reasons.


What you cannot do


if you have fever or other symptoms it is ""strongly recommended"" to stay at home.
go to a secondary place of residence such as a a holiday home.
go for a walk without any other purpose.
all kind of gatherings: discos, cinemas, pubs, theaters, etc. are closed.
all schools and universities are closed.
religious gatherings are suspended (e.g. Sunday mass).
""non-essential"" (see above) shops are closed.


What happens to transgressors

Police can stop people to check that they are out for a legitimate purpose. Transgressors can be arrested (up to 3 months) or fined (up to 206€), and the violation will enter their criminal record. Shops that disobey regulations will be closed for 5 up to 30 days. 

Numerous violations have already been reported: this newspaper article mentions 46000 violations reported by the authorities and 1500 closed shops in the past week of lockdown.

There have been various appeals from various artists and public figures urging Italians to stay at home and respect these measures (see e.g. this Youtube search).

Comparison with China

I do not have direct experience, but from what I understand measures in China were more severe: for instance this Wikipedia article mentions that 


  [in many cities, districts, and counties across mainland China] only one person from each household is permitted to go outside for provisions once every two days, except for medical reasons or to work at shops or pharmacies.


I welcome a similar answer from the point of view of Chinese citizens.
",Reasonable,"It is considered so serious that the Equality and Human Rights Commission has opened an investigation into it (the EHRC will report in 2020). Initially:


  Having received a number of complaints regarding antisemitism in the
  Labour Party, we believe the Labour Party may have unlawfully
  discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious
  beliefs.
  
  Our concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory
  enforcement powers. As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now
  engaging with the Labour Party to give them an opportunity to respond


Then:


  We contacted The Labour Party after receiving a number of complaints
  about allegations of antisemitism in the party.
  
  We have carefully considered the response we have received from the
  Party and have opened a formal investigation.
  
  We are using our powers under the Equality Act to open an
  investigation, which will look at:
  
  
  whether unlawful acts have been committed by the Party or its employees or agents
  the steps taken by the Party to implement the recommendations made in the reports on antisemitism by Baroness Royall, the Home Affairs
  Select Committee and in the Chakrabarti Report
  whether the Rule Book and the Party’s investigatory and disciplinary processes have enabled or could enable it to deal
  efficiently and effectively with complaints of race or religion or
  belief discrimination and racial harassment or victimisation,
  including whether appropriate sanctions have been or could be applied
  whether the Party has responded to complaints of unlawful acts in a lawful, efficient and effective manner
  


Labour is the first political party to be the subject of a formal EHRC investigation into institutional racism since the inquiry into the neo-Nazi British National Party (probably rather fewer surprises in that report). 

The Labour Against Anti-Semitism group claims to have submitted 15,000 pages of evidence that more than a thousand Labour members are anti-semitic and that the party has failed to take proper action. 

In an article for the Times titled, ""The way in which the leadership of the Labour Party has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud"", The Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, has also weighed in. No Chief Rabbi has commented on a general election before like this. 

In 2016, Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee ran an inquiry into anti-semitism in the UK and devoted a substantial part of their report to the Labour party. The Committee found ""no reliable, empirical evidence to support the notion that there is a higher prevalence of antisemitic attitudes within the Labour Party than any other political party"" - indeed it's by no means the worst - but said the leadership's lack of action ""risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally antisemitic"". 

The Committee criticised the Chakrabati Inquiry report into anti-semitism in the Labour party published earlier in the same year, describing it as ""compromised"", and said Corbyn didn't understand ""the distinct nature of post-second-world-war antisemitism"".


  Clearly, the Labour Leader is not directly responsible for abuse
  committed in his name, but we believe that his lack of consistent
  leadership on this issue, and his reluctance to separate antisemitism
  from other forms of racism, has created what some have referred to as
  a ‘safe space’ for those with vile attitudes towards Jewish people.
  This situation has been further exacerbated by the Party’s
  demonstrable incompetence at dealing with members accused of
  antisemitism, as illustrated by the saga involving the suspension,
  re-admittance and re-suspension of Jackie Walker. The ongoing
  membership of Ken Livingstone, following his outbursts about Hitler
  and Zionism, should also have been dealt with more effectively. The
  result is that the Labour Party, with its proud history of fighting
  racism and promoting equal rights, is seen by some as an unwelcoming
  place for Jewish members and activists.
  
  The decision by the Leader of the Labour Party to commission an
  independent inquiry into antisemitism was a welcome one,
  notwithstanding subsequent criticisms. The Chakrabarti report makes
  recommendations about creating a more robust disciplinary process
  within the Labour Party, but it is clearly lacking in many areas;
  particularly in its failure to differentiate explicitly between racism
  and antisemitism. The fact that the report describes occurrences of
  antisemitism merely as “unhappy incidents” also suggests that it fails
  to appreciate the full gravity of the comments that prompted the
  inquiry in the first place. These shortfalls, combined with Ms
  Chakrabarti’s decision to join the Labour Party in April and accept a
  peerage as a nominee of the Leader of that Party, and her subsequent
  appointment as Shadow Attorney General, have thrown into question her
  claims (and those of Mr Corbyn) that her inquiry was truly
  independent. Ms Chakrabarti has not been sufficiently open with the
  Committee about when she was offered her peerage, despite several
  attempts to clarify this issue with her. It is disappointing that she
  did not foresee that the timing of her elevation to the House of
  Lords, alongside a report absolving the Labour Leader of any
  responsibility for allegations of increased antisemitism within his
  Party, would completely undermine her efforts to address this issue.
  It is equally concerning that Mr Corbyn did not consider the damaging
  impression likely to be created by this sequence of events.


For an organisation to be institutionally racist, we don't mean that every member is racist or even most members are racist, or that there is intent in the organisation to be racist - it is about outcomes. If the totality of the body's efforts (their complaints, procedures, investigations, disciplinaries etc) or lack of efforts lead to racist outcomes, it's institutionally racist. 


  ""the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate
  and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or
  ethnic origin"", which ""can be seen or detected in processes,
  attitudes, and behaviour, which amount to discrimination through
  unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist
  stereotyping, which disadvantages minority ethnic people."" - Sir
  William Macpherson


There is a not unfounded perception that Labour has, over time, been very slow to investigate, failed to take action against anti-semitic members, ignored the problem, denied the existence of the problem, doubled down on causing the bad outcomes, blamed the complainants and even driven some of the complainants out of the party.

In April 2019 the Sunday Times published a story headed, ""Labour’s hate files expose Jeremy Corbyn’s anti‑semite army"" (paywall):


  The Labour Party has failed to take disciplinary action against
  hundreds of members accused of anti-semitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s
  leadership, according to internal documents leaked to The Sunday
  Times.
  
  A hard drive of emails and a confidential database last updated on
  March 8 reveal how the party’s system for dealing with such complaints
  is bedevilled by delays, inaction and interference from the leader’s
  office. They reveal members investigated for posting such online
  comments as “Heil Hitler”, “F*** the Jews” and “Jews are the problem”
  have not been expelled, even though the party received the complaints
  a year ago.


The newspaper claimed the leaks showed that more than half of the cases remained unresolved to March 2019 and in 28% of them there had been no investigation.

In July 2019, BBC's Panorama reported in a programme titled “Is Labour Antisemitic?” (iPlayer link) reported among other things that Corbyn’s general secretary Jennie Formby, chief of staff Karie Murphy, director of strategy Seumas Milne and adviser Andrew Murray meddled in what were supposed to be independent investigations, overruling and downgrading penalties. It appeared to be a party concerned with damage control instead of investigating complaints.

Worse, Corbyn himself has often seemed to believe there hasn't been a problem or not cared if there was. He has also shared platforms with anti-semitic people, such as proponents of killing Jews (e.g. Hamas and Hezbollah) and even supported them. I think that in those respects, as in the IRA involvement, Corbyn's political judgment on this has been spectacularly poor for an MP and would-be PM. As the-then Labour Chief Whip said of Corbyn inviting two convicted IRA terrorists to Parliament two weeks after the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing: 


  I think that, unless you are very very careful, any contact with
  people of this sort gives credence to their cause, and unless you are
  very careful that can lead to people thinking you are actually
  indifferent to the outrage, the suffering, the killing and the maiming
  which is the direct consequence of the actions of people who are
  terrorists.


Corbyn once supported Blood Libel proponent Raed Salah, for example. Corbyn has denied being aware that such individuals have made antisemitic remarks but their remarks and affiliations have been a matter of public record - he could have looked into the people he was to support or share a platform with. So at best he was utterly careless about who he supported. Here is a timeline of some of his behaviour, some of which beggars belief.

This caused nearly ever major event to be cancelled and caused tremendous losses for the economy. But is there already a long term plan on bringing the economy back to life? Surely countries cannot just live in quarantine forever? 

Only notable exception that I'm aware of is Boris Johnson announcing that the UK will be following a different approach:


  Defending Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision not to follow other European countries by closing schools and banning mass gatherings, Patrick Vallance said it was the government’s aim to “reduce the peak of the epidemic, pull it down and broaden it” while protecting the elderly and vulnerable


So the UK's long term plan seems to be ""business as usual"", but what about others?
",50981,"
Germany has pretty supportive laws in place for people who are personally quarantined, basically paid sick days off. This will have the effect of supporting domestic demand during the crisis.
That does not cover the general economic downturn for people who are not directly sick or quarantined, so the government decided on tax deferments and a loan program for businesses.
There is also the possibility of payments from the unemployment insurance system for workers who had their working hours reduced, this allows companies to avoid layoffs.

51052,How can a ban on people gathering be enforced when it is imposed for an epidemic?,"I noticed that a lot of countries introducing quarantines and other measures to fight COVID-19 also included a ban on people gathering. I am wondering, how can it be enforced?

When a government wants to stop people protests and similar actions the ban can be easily enforced, because protesters must put themselves in evidence otherwise their protest would have no purpose. But in the case of an epidemic the ban should prevent also people gathering in a discreet manner in a backstreet or a public garden. No country, not even the authoritarian ones have enough policemen to monitor every single corner. 

Furthermore if people violate the ban and refuse to pay the fine, what are they going to do? Put them in a crowded prison? Wouldn't that defeat the purpose?

Last detail if there are limits in the way a ban can be enforced. How effective can a ban be at preventing public gatherings? 

Edit: 

I would like to point out something that none of the answers considers. When a government gives an order, or issues a prohibition, then they have to enforce it, it is also a strong commitment for the state itself. This means devoting a large portion of the police force to it while they could have been employed for other tasks. Furthermore the stronger the prohibition the higher the chance that some people may eventually challenge it and lead to confrontations with the police forces.

Had there been just a ban on public events plus a recommendation to people not to gather in big number, without such a strong commitment, what would have been the difference in effectiveness and pressure put on the police force and other state resources?
",51053,"
  I am wondering, how can it be enforced?


By the authorities, wielding the law and their monopoly on the use of force. I think society, the mainstream media and social media will also create social pressure and consequences.

Obviously the effectiveness of the ban depends on the proportion of people abiding by it. That a minority will inevitably flout the ban does not mean the ban is wholly useless.


  Furthermore if people violate the ban and refuse to pay the fine, what
  are they going to do? Put them in a crowded prison?


Yes, ban violators might be imprisoned.

If the person is not infected, the prisoners are no worse off. If the person is infected, perhaps he or she can be put in solitary confinement or a repurposed toilet paper warehouse. Whether the person is infected or not infected, society is better off. 

There is no country on the planet that can cope with large proportions of their populations being hospitalised (particularly if they need intensive care or mechanical ventilation), which is one of the things that such a ban is intended to reduce the risk of.

Depends on the country. In China, some types of breaking the quarantine result in execution. That's not a joke.

In some other countries (e.g. South Korea, Singapore) you may be charged with manslaughter, criminal neglect, public endangerment and similar crimes. Even if you don't go to prison right now (you probably still will, as you've shown you are more dangerous to the society outside of it), when it's all over in a couple years, you absolutely will go to prison for a long time.

",51081,"This has been explored by Berens et al. [1], from the Reputation Institute, the publishers of the annual RepTrak country reputation rankings. In their chapter in the International Place Branding Yearbook 2011, they provide an overview of their methodology, which seeks to measure a country's reputation in much the same way that one might measure the reputation of an individual or a company. 

They argue that this reputation is linked intrinsically to the overall international trust of a country, something which is backed up by Klewes &amp; Wreschniok [2], which states that the link between reputation and trust is ""fundamental and indispensable"", arguing that "" trust is based on the experience
that an agent has fulfilled our expectations in the past.""

They list 11 different attributes, which fit into three different dimensions. These are:


Advanced Economy


An important contributor to global culture
Is technologically advanced
Is inventive
Produces high-quality products and services

Appealing Environment


Offers appealing lifestyle
An enjoyable country
A beautiful country

Effective Government 


Offers a favorable environment for doing business
Has adopted progressive social and economic policies
Is a responsible participant in the global community
Is run by an effective government



The testing methodology consisted of a large random sample (n=26,000) of consumers in the G8 countries, combined with an additional sample (n=19,000) from the country in question drawn from its own citizens. Responses were adjusted to take into account general per-country bias - for example, respondents from Greece generally will have a good opinion of Cyprus.

A further dimension which was measured was ""Supportive Behaviors"". This measured the willingness of consumers to visit, live in, invest in, work in, and buy products from the country.

In conclusion then, while the study in question is conducted by surveying populations, it seems possible that a similar study could be conducted which measures at least some of these criteria objectively. Certainly, factors such as ""willingness to invest"" and ""technological advancement"" could be measured using economic data. However, it would seem that the best way to measure the reputation of a country will probably be to survey the opinions of global respondents through large-scale polling, as the factors that the study found had the most effect on a country's reputation were attributes such as ""Offers an appealing lifestyle"", ""Is a responsible participant in the global community"", and ""Is a beautiful country"", which would seem to be more abstract factors.

",Reasonable,"Because the two main parties absorb emergent third parties

Any time any third party starts to get serious traction in the United States, it eventually will find one of the major parties shifting its platform to absorb those voters into its coalition.

Unlike most of the other parties in America, the Democrats and the Republicans are both in the business of winning elections. Allowing a third party to just show up someplace would be political malpractice of the highest order. The smart thing to do is to go straight to those voters and say ""I know the New Center Party is offering you X, we can give you X also, and we have the additional benefit of being a real governing party that can actually make that happen."" So, that's typically what happens. 

Ever heard of the Reform Party? It was founded by Ross Perot, who got 18.6% of the popular vote for President in 1992, and 8.1% of the popular vote in 1996. It tried to be a centrist alternative to the two other parties, and it may have cost George H. W. Bush re-election (who, it should be noted, committed political malpractice of the highest order by promising no new taxes, and then passing new taxes, thereby making a lot of his voters angry). You may have heard of some of their more famous Presidential candidates: Pat Buchanan and Donald Trump. 

Those two guys are Republicans now, and at the same time, what the Republican Party is about changed quite a bit, and is still in the process of changing. The Reform Party was in favor of reducing immigration; before Donald Trump, many Republican politicians wanted to increase legal immigration through comprehensive immigration reform. The Reform Party was opposed to this thing called the North American Free Trade Agreement; before Trump, many Republican politicians were in favor of free trade agreements as part of a commitment to free market economics. 

The GOP saw in 1992 that there was 18.6% of the voters in the country who wanted an alternative to the other parties that they could pick up, so they expanded their tent to try to pick them up; 24 years later all of those voters who still think that way are Republican voters for Donald Trump.

This is just one worked example; other historical examples are the Progressive Party at the turn of the century, and anything that could have become a successful US Communist party.

Why didn't this happen with the Libertarian Party or the Green Party or any of those other parties you mentioned? Simple; they are not very popular, in part because most of the people who might find them ideologically pleasing are probably already voting for Republicans or Democrats just to get their achievable policy goals accomplished. So, they continue as vanity projects for rich donors and that stubborn guy who just can't let anyone be wrong on the Internet.

Also, not ""identifying with"" a party doesn't mean people will not vote for it

Just because most people don't want to identify themselves as Republicans or Democrats, doesn't mean that they actually aren't willing to vote for them. It is a well known social science phenomena that most people who call themselves independents are actually moderate partisans. That is, they may say they're independent, but that doesn't mean they're as ready to jump ship for a center third party.

No.  The president is not the FDA, and the president's statements about FDA actions are not FDA actions.  The only official source of information about drug approvals is the FDA's list of approved drugs.  See 21 CFR 314.3:


  Listed drug is a new drug product that has been approved under section 505(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for safety and effectiveness or under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which has not been withdrawn or suspended under section 505(e)(1) through (5) or section 505(j)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and which has not been withdrawn from sale for what FDA has determined are reasons of safety or effectiveness. Listed drug status is evidenced by the drug product's identification in the current edition of FDA's “Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (the list) as an approved drug. A drug product is deemed to be a listed drug on the date of approval for the NDA or ANDA for that drug product.

Note that the Constitution limits the extent of the punishment, which gives leave for the Senate to ""sentence"" a person convicted to a punishment that is less extreme than removal and disqualification.

b) of two countries that haven’t been fully explored

c) and the border wasn’t clearly defined. 

even not 1850.

And what sense would it make to close a border of 2 countries if you can’t control it as there are so few inhabitants like in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming etc?

Even today it must be rather a symbolic gesture to close the border: Highways, Railway, Airports.

",Reasonable,"Official position of India's government


  Seeking to get legal clearance for the deportation plan, the home ministry told the Supreme Court this week it would confidentially provide it with intelligence information showing Rohingya links with Pakistan-based militants.  (source)
  
  “Our investigations have revealed that Al Qaeda wants to use India and Bangladesh as their base to start a religious war against Myanmar,” said New Delhi police official Pramod Singh Khuswah. “Clearly they are a threat to our security.” 


Other likely reasons


Demographics.

Rohingyas are majority Muslim. India has no desire to have more Muslims living there (it has enough friction with its own Muslim population and Muslim neighbors without adding the need for more). Bangladesh (which is majority Muslim) seems a better place from India's point of view

Additionally, Rohingyas are ethnically closer to Benghali than average Indian populace (though who and what they are seems to be rather convoluted mix). So, India gets to claim ""they are your people, they are your problem"" to Bangladesh.
Economics.

Housing and hosting a large # of refugees is a big economic drain - even more so when the refugees are not homogenuous with native populace (which removes local sources of bootstrapping for refugee individuals AND reduces overall trust capital of the area which reduces economy).

As such, if India has an option of ""we get to pay for hundreds of thousands of refugees, or we punt that on Bangladesh"", the preferred option for Indian government is kind of obvious.

What sources can show more information about what politicians think about preparing for future pandemics right now?
",51157,"Right now, as Covid-19 is on-going, they can't do very much to prepare for a hypothetical Covid-??. However, once the Covid-19 situation has ended, then it would be vital to do a thorough analysis of what worked, and didn't work in the Covid-19 situation.

This is one of the reasons, why the East-Asian countries, such as Hong Kong or Korea have fared so well compared to Europe; they could build on first hand experience of the SARS and MERS outbreaks.

The somewhat sad lesson is that we are smarter only afterwards. Any attempts to predict the future, and act accordingly to these predictions is bound to fail at least in part of the cases.

You find plenty of articles in the media, comparing the current, local situation to those in the East Asian countries, such as this one from the BBC. Whereever, you are from, you probably will be able to find a corresponding article from your local media, at least I have found such articles from German media.
",Reasonable,"The mathematical phenomenon you're talking about is Arrow's impossibility theorem. The wiki article has an informal proof.

Specifically, the theorem states that there's no way to design a voting system such that all three of these criteria hold:


  
  If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
  If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).
  There is no ""dictator"": no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group's preference.
  


(The theorem is stated in terms of a rank-order voting system. The winner-take-all and first-past-the-post systems are degenerate cases of this; each voter is asked only for their first preference, and the candidate who is the first preference of a majority or plurality of voters wins.)

Every democratic voting system fulfills the first and third criteria; therefore, they have to dispense with the second. This means that (for example) even if 60% of voters favor Candidate Alice over Candidate Bob, it's still possible for Bob to beat Alice. In a winner-take-all or first-past-the-post system, the way this would happen is through the introduction of a third candidate. If 30% of the voters now prefer Carl as their top choice, and all of those voters previously favored Alice over Bob, then Bob now has 40% of the vote while Alice and Carl each have 30%; Bob has beaten Alice. Voting systems such as instant-runoff voting can ameliorate this, but according to Arrow's impossibility theorem, they cannot entirely eliminate the possibility of a situation where Bob beats Alice even though a majority of the voters prefer Alice over Bob.

The most important practical implication of this is that a democratic voting system can't entirely eliminate the spoiler effect. More broadly, it means the possibility always exists that it's in a voter's interest to vote in a way that doesn't reflect their true preferences; in other words, tactical voting is always a factor in elections. Most people in democratic countries accept this as an unfortunate reality of the system.  Even so, some systems (such as winner-take-all) are more heavily impacted by tactical voting than others (such as instant-runoff).

51215,Can the Chinese or S Korean COVID approaches be implemented in the US (or Europe)?,"The ""Daily"" NY Times podcast for 3/12/20 described two effective management schemes for handling the epidemic.  Briefly:

Chinese: Check everyone's temperature frequently on a massive scale.  Track individuals with QR codes.  Use a flow chart procedure to confirm or eliminate a COVID hypothesis, and put affected individuals in government quarantine as needed, separating confirmed cases within a family so as to minimize contagion within families.

The flow chart procedure was describe as follows: screen for body temperature and cough. Eliminate bacterial infection and allergy as possible. Cat scan for pneumonia.

Also an NPR report described an online support group led by a social worker that included quarantine graduates who gave descriptions of quarantine living conditions, including food, and gave advice about what to take along to quarantine.  These services apparently helped people cope positively with fears of quarantine.

South Korean: Extensive testing and thorough, meticulous exposure tracing.

My question is, would it be possible to implement one or both of these in the United States (or Europe)?
",51219,"""From the helicopter"" there is now a more general claim (e.g. in the following McKinsey slide) that Western countries are trying to emulate China and/or South Korea's response:



The devil might be in the details, of course. Getting to the details might be too involved/broad in a question like this, not specific to a pair of countries. There's for example a China-US comparison in a recent BI article, too long to quote here in its entirety, of course. But some things that were probably not done in the West was a complete shutdown of travel, e.g.


  ""These draconian measures seem to have worked to bring down the cases in a very short period of time in China,"" Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Business Insider. ""Although there is a cost to the economy, to society, not to mention also the second-order problems, like access to health care for people without the coronavirus. The question is whether the United States is willing to pay such a high price."" [...] Huang says he cannot imagine an America where many of these measures are implemented. [...]
  
  During the height of the outbreak, trains didn't stop at the disease's epicenter, Wuhan. [...] ""Cutting off transportation was considered on the top three measures to contain the spread of the virus,"" Huang told Business Insider. ""But it would hard to imagine the complete shutdown of an American city due to government order.""


And regarding tracking of people's movement


  ""It would be a big change right for the US people to get accustomed to,"" said Huang, ""if the government wants to use this high tech means, like using the cell phones to monitor the movement of the people.""
  
  Huang added that even though there is little technological barrier to doing this, this kind of behavior is considered a form of digital authoritarianism, that involves uses privacy issues. Huang would be hard-pressed to imagine the US government using this approach to containing the spread of the coronavirus.


China also apparently co-opted every (""private"") security guard in the effort to keep people in their homes:


  ""In America, you have to stay at home, but there's no police,"" said Huang. ""There's no one actively enforcing that rule, but in China, you have what are basically security guards on patrol of every residence to make sure they don't violate the government containment measures. That's a kind of approach I think can't be copied here in the United States.""


Likewise for suspending ""non-essential"" medical access:


  In China, elective surgeries and other non-critical doctors visits were delayed, and many medical services were moved online. [...]  But the move hasn't been without negative consequences. One man with kidney disease in China jumped to his death, Human Rights Watch reported. He couldn't get dialysis during the outbreak. Another boy with cerebral palsy died after being left alone for six days while his father was quarantined in China. 


A similar opinion was voiced in a Time interview:


  “No other nation (western or otherwise) can or should seek to replicate China’s actions,” Thomas Bollyky, the director of the Global Health Program at the Washington D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations, tells TIME via email. “The disregard for civil liberties and human rights that the government has demonstrated in its quarantine and censorship activities are inseparable from the policies and actions of the government that contributed to the outbreak in the first place.”


Other experts quoted earlier in a Science (news) piece were also skeptical that the full extent of China's measures could be copied in the West:


  The question now is whether the world can take lessons from China’s apparent success—and whether the massive lockdowns and electronic surveillance measures imposed by an authoritarian government would work in other countries. [...]
  
  “This report poses difficult questions for all countries currently considering their response to COVID-19,” says Steven Riley, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. “The joint mission was highly productive and gave a unique insight into China’s efforts to stem the virus from spread within mainland China and globally,” adds Lawrence Gostin, a global health law scholar at Georgetown University. But Gostin warns against applying the model elsewhere. “I think there are very good reasons for countries to hesitate using these kinds of extreme measures.”
  
  There’s also uncertainty about what the virus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2, will do in China after the country inevitably lifts some of its strictest control measures and restarts its economy. COVID-19 cases may well increase again.


More recent cases from Hong Kong indicate that that fear of re-emergence may well be have been justified. So Hong Kong is back into lock down after it was largely lifted at the beginning of March.

Similar expert opinion on restrictions timing:


  Epidemiologists say China’s mammoth response had one glaring flaw: it started too late. In the initial weeks of the outbreak in December and January, Wuhan authorities were slow to report cases of the mysterious infection, which delayed measures to contain it, says Howard Markel, a public-health researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “The delay of China to act is probably responsible for this world event,” says Markel.
  
  A model simulation by Lai Shengjie and Andrew Tatem, emerging-disease researchers at the University of Southampton, UK, shows that if China had implemented its control measures a week earlier, it could have prevented 67% of all cases there. Implementing the measures 3 weeks earlier, from the beginning of January, would have cut the number of infections to 5% of the total. [...]
  
  But between 16 and 30 January, a period that included the first 7 days of the lockdown, the number of people each infected individual gave the virus to dropped to 1.05, estimates Adam Kucharski, who models infectious-disease spread at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “That was amazing,” he says. [...]
  
  “These extreme limitations on population movement have been quite successful,” says Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease scientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. [... However,] China is suppressing the virus, not eradicating it, says Osterholm. The world will need to wait until about eight weeks after China resumes to some form of normality to know what it did or didn’t accomplish with its population-movement limitations, he says.
  
  There is probably a fierce debate going on in China about when to relax the lockdown measures, says Roy Anderson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. He suggests there could be a second wave of new infections when they are lifted.


So whether it's possible to (fully) emulate China's response (in the West) depends not only on the political framework, but also to which experts the (Western) governments might be paying [most] attention to.

I realize this is a long answer already, but there was a recent interview with one of China's [own] CDC officials (whom seldom get interviewed in the West). Some interesting points from there:


  Q: What mistakes are other countries making?
  
  A: The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks. [...]
  
  Q: People who tested positive in Wuhan but only had mild disease were sent into isolation in large facilities and were not allowed to have visits from family. Is this something other countries should consider?
  
  A: Infected people must be isolated. [...]
  
  Q: Spread in China has dwindled to a crawl, and the new confirmed cases are mainly people entering the country, correct?
  
  A: Yes. At the moment, we don’t have any local transmission, but the problem for China now is the imported cases. So many infected travelers are coming into China.




More recently (April 2) it has been reported by DW that Germany is considering a voluntary phone app similar to the (mandatory?) one[s] used in China:


  The most famous health app was developed by the tech giant Alibaba in conjunction with the Chinese authorities. Other companies have also developed similar software, however. It was possible to work swiftly because the Chinese state already has access regarding citizens' movements and programmers did not have to worry about data protection laws. [...]
  
  There are many who hope that Germany will soon be using such an app. The Health Ministry and researchers at the Robert Koch Institute are developing similar software. The idea is to introduce a non-compulsory app that will not be able to detect who met whom and where but will be able to identify if a phone user was in close contact with another infected user.
  
  The app will only really be able to function if 60 percent of the population uses it. In Germany, it won't be as easy as in Asia to reach such a percentage.
  
  Will Germans cooperate?
  
  Half of the respondents to a recent poll said they would not oppose an app to help warn users who had come into contact with someone infected with COVID-19. 


They don't link to the poll, but I guess in was a poll in Germany given that this was an article on DW.

There's now a BBC video discussing Chinese-inspired surveillance measures to combat the outbreak. This is of course somewhat subjective, but they only short-listed Singapore, Israel, Iran, Taiwan and Russia as being closest to China-style surveillance measures used to combat the epidemic, like using CCTV cameras and phone tracking.

51220,Why was the World Health Organization against travel restrictions following the COVID-19 outbreak?,"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization initially opposed countries instituting travel or trade restrictions.



Why did they oppose these policies at that time? Is there any evidence that non-medical considerations such as political pressure played a role in the World Health Organization's decision?
",51221,"Probably because prior WHO research was rather skeptical of their ultimate effectiveness:  


  Screening and quarantining entering travelers at international borders did not substantially delay virus introduction in past pandemics, except in some island countries, and will likely be even less effective in the modern era.


That paper was co-authored (on behalf of the WHO) by employees of the [US] CDC (lead author actually), the ECDC, the UK's HPA, Australian DHA, and some of WHO's own employees. So you could say it was a fairly broad consensus at the time it was written (2006).

The WHO has actually explained/defended their reasoning in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak in more detail in a February press release:


  WHO continues to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks.
  
  In general, evidence shows that restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies is ineffective in most situations and may divert resources from other interventions. Furthermore, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative social and economic effects on the affected countries. However, in certain circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful, such as in settings with few international connections and limited response capacities.
  
  Travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic may only be justified at the beginning of an outbreak, as they may allow countries to gain time, even if only a few days, to rapidly implement effective preparedness measures. Such restrictions must be based on a careful risk assessment, be proportionate to the public health risk, be short in duration, and be reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.
  
  Travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact. Since WHO declaration of a public health emergency of international concern in relation to COVID-19, and as of 27 February, 38 countries have reported to WHO additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic in relation to travel to and from China or other countries, ranging from denial of entry of passengers, visa restrictions or quarantine for returning travellers. Several countries that denied entry of travellers or who have suspended the flights to and from China or other affected countries, are now reporting cases of COVID-19.
  
  Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. [...]


I haven't found more recent press releases on this matter, especially after the US and the EU have imposed much more wider travel bans. I do wonder the extent to which the WHO might have reconsidered that initial approach...

Aside, comment on the question... I wonder why you found it necessary to use ""that guy from India"" as the motivator for this question when (in the US) a poll published on March 26 says...


  In thinking about specific steps that have been announced to address the coronavirus outbreak, majorities of Republicans and Democrats view a range of measures as necessary to stem the spread of the virus. For example, overwhelming majorities of both Republicans (96%) and Democrats (94%) say restricting international travel to the U.S. is necessary.

51231,What is the current paid leave system in the United States given the COVID-19 outbreak?,"The US has enacted law H.R.6201 - Families First Coronavirus Response Act which seems to mainly tackle elementary/secondary students' food availability, but also expanded FMLA among other things. I've seen various posts on Facebook that are, at best, outdated or, at worst, straight-up false. Some of the posts I've seen state that the US is requiring 2-week paid leave. But the summary of the law makes it sound like that falls to the state's unemployment program. When reading the actual text of the law regarding paid leave, it states that the first 10 days are unpaid; any leave after that is paid. So what does paid leave look like then?

For example, my place of business is shutting down next week, March 30th, and maybe subsequent weeks. I'm told that I can use PTO (of which I have none) or draw unemployment. Assuming that COVID-19 cases skyrocket in my county and we shutdown for more than 10 days, do I start getting paid on Day 11?

To further muddy the water, there is an exemption for businesses with fewer than 50 employees. I think this replaces the previous exemption of businesses with more than 500 employees. 

If the above is correct, let's say my factory (in Kansas) has 150 employees, but is owned by a company (national, but headquartered in Michigan) with >>500 employees. The company is a subsidiary of a larger, international corporation (I have no idea how many are employed under the corporation). 

Do I still qualify for paid leave on Day 1? Day 11? Not at all (this is America; bootstraps etc)? 

Assume that I am a healthy, essential employee with no children. Why we're still shutting down despite being deemed essential is beyond me.

For what kind of coverage a smaller company can expect, this fact sheet also provided by DoL states that:


  Generally, the Act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for:
  
  
  Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at the employee’s regular rate of pay where the employee is unable to work because the employee is quarantined (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), and/or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis; or
  Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay because the employee is unable to work because of a bona fide need to care for an individual subject to quarantine (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), or to care for a child (under 18 years of age) whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19, and/or the employee is experiencing a substantially similar condition as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor; and
  Up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay where an employee, who has been employed for at least 30 calendar days, is unable to work due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19.
  


To summarize, paid leave applies if the private sector employee shows symptoms of COVID-19, is told to self-quarantine by health care provider, is quarantined by federal/state/local order, or if employee is taking care of a family member that qualifies for one of the above reasons or if employee's child(ren) is stuck at home due to school/daycare closures related to COVID-19.

Turkish army has to go through the Kurds' lands. That seems impossible without fighting against Kurds first. And that would be both troublesome and frown upon by USA.
Turkey has no national interest in fighting against ISIS. They are not a threat for Turkey for a moment. Only media make people think of ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". Politicians do think of ""allies"" and ""enemies"".
Today Syria appears to be a total chaos; bellum omnia contra omnes. If Turkish army invaded Syria on its own (no alliance), then in a few weeks they would fight against all sides, just as it's happening now: ISIS against SAR, ISIS against An-Nusra, An-Nusra against FSA, FSA against SAR and so on. That's simply not an option. Yet making any alliance without prior approving by ""the friends from NATO"" is too much even for Turkey.

51246,"If the UK Prime Minister suddenly dies, what happens?","With the news that Boris Johnson has tested positive for COVID-19, and was later hospitalised, a question occurred to me: 

What happens if the UK Prime Minister suddenly dies?  

I know that the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the party with the most seats, and presumably the party would somehow choose a new leader as soon as they can.  However, organizing a vote of the Conservative part membership would still require at least a few days under normal circumstances;  and under the current circumstances, it might take significantly longer.  

Is there simply no Prime Minister until the governing party can choose another one?  If so, how are the functions of the head of government performed during this time?

I'd be interested in knowing how this would work (if it's any different) in other Westminster systems as well.  I saw the question on What happens if the UK Prime Minister resigns?, but the answer there assumes a orderly transition period during which the incumbent continues to serve while a new party leader is chosen.  
",51247,"Your understanding is correct - there is no UK Prime Minister until one is appointed by the Queen. In the meantime, the Civil Contingencies Act (2004) gives the Monarch (in practice, government ministers) powers to make emergency regulations, and COBRA meetings can be chaired by any Cabinet minister - after 9/11, these were chaired by the Cabinet Secretary until the PM could attend himself.

The Queen will appoint as PM the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons. In practice, this is the person chosen as the leader of the party with the most MPs - in this case, the party that the deceased PM previously led. How this is chosen, and how quickly, will depend on the party in question, although in these circumstances it seems likely that an interim leader would be speedily chosen. The Labour Party's rules for this are described in Steve Melnikoff's answer here. In the case of the Conservative Party, their constitution states under Schedule 2 - Rules for the Election of the Leader that:


  
  Upon the initiation of an election for the Leader, it shall be the
  duty of the 1922 Committee to present to the Party, as soon as
  reasonably practicable, a choice of candidates for election as Leader.
  The rules for deciding the procedure by which the 1922 Committee
  selects candidates for submission for election shall be determined by
  the Executive Committee of the 1922 Committee after consultation of
  the Board. 
  If there is only one candidate at the time laid down for
  the close of nominations, that candidate shall be declared Leader of
  the Party.
  


It would be possible, then, for MPs to be strongly encouraged to only nominate one candidate in order to conclude this process as quickly as possible, without a full membership vote. You may remember in 2016, for example, Andrea Leadson withdrew from the leadership contest leaving Theresa May as the sole candidate, which meant that there was no ballot of the party membership.

In the specific case you raise, however, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was given the role of 'Designated Survivor' on March 22nd, and will carry out Johnson's duties that he can't perform himself while he is affected by the virus. It should be noted that this role is not an official post, and if Johnson were to die from the virus then it is not a given that Raab would be appointed leader of the party and therefore the new PM. In fact, the article notes that this designation was challenged by some in the Cabinet, who thought that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, should have been given the role, and  indeed; Gove replaced Johnson at the daily press briefing on March 27th. Another contender might be Jeremy Hunt, against whom Johnson won the Conservative  Party leadership election in 2019.

As for other Westminster systems, there is no blanket answer to that question. It is perfectly possible for a bill to be introduced that immediately designates the new Prime Minister on their death, as in the US system. Indeed, in 2013, Peter Bone MP introduced the Prime Minister (Replacement) Bill, which contains the following provision:


  In the event of the death or incapacitation of a person holding the
  title of Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury, the title,
  salary and functions of that role shall be conferred upon another
  Secretary or Minister of State in accordance with the following order
  of precedence— 
  
  
  (a) person bearing the designation of Deputy Prime
  Minister; 
  (b) Secretary of State with responsibility for Home Affairs;

This bill did not make it onto the statute books, but it proves the point that it is possible for an order of succession to exist in a Westminster system.
",Reasonable,"TL;DR Yes, see ""primitive communism"".

There is no NPOV answer to your questions, it all depends on your definitions and judgment of evidence. My answer is an attempt to explain things according to the point of view of Marx &amp; Engels.

Full disclosure: I consider myself a communist.

According to Marx, the answer to the question is Yes.

To be communist, a society MUST be non-dictatorial - as dictatorship necessarily requires a state to control the means of production. If you do not have a means of coercion to control the means of production (army, police, etc.) - then you do not have a state.


  ""When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of
  a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its
  political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely
  the organized power of one class for oppressing another. If the
  proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by
  the force of circumstances, to organize itself as a class; if, by
  means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such,
  sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will,
  along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the
  existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will
  thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class. In place of the
  old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we
  shall have an association in which the free development of each is the
  condition for the free development of all."", Communist Manifesto,
  Chapter 2


Therefore it is a logical impossibility that there should be communist society that is dictatorial. Rather, the question is then: Has there ever been a communist society? If there has not been, then the answer to your question is No, otherwise Yes.

Communist societies have existed before the state ever existed, in the form that Marx refers to as ""primitive communism""

Adding to the requirement of a stateless and classless society - in order to have communism, you must also abolish value itself. In Marxist theory, value is not the same as prince, and value is not the same as exchange value or use value. In Marx terms, value is the 'socially necessary abstract labor' embodied in a commodity. A commodity is any good or service produced by human labor and offered as a product for general sale on the market. To abolish value, you must abolish commodities and therefore markets.

@DVK is mostly incorrect, but @jvm is incorrect in other aspects too:

@jvm: Marx was certainly a Marxist, but said he was not as a way of saying, ""if this is Marxism, then I'm not a Marxist"" against the French communists &amp; Paul Lafargue. Discussion on: I'm not a Marxist

Now to the few examples pointed out: Early christian communites, Kibbutzim, early workers' soviets (= councils) in Russia, The Paris Commune, Anarchism during the spanish civil war, particularly around Barcelona.

In none of these examples can we reasonably expect that the market or state was abolished as these societies either operated within a bigger picture where it was not abolished. In early Soviet Russia just after the revolution the market was certainly not dissolved. The Paris Commune was attacked and had armed forces. If you trade with places where the market still exists then commodities still exist. Anarchism during the Spanish Civil War was during a civil war - therefore they were fighting to uphold a means of production - therefore not communism.

The claim that @DVK makes that communism would somehow be an impossibility due to genes and how we evolved, i.e: ""greed is in human nature"" would require some scientific claims in the field of neuroscience and evolutionary biology. When it comes to biology, we are as genetically close to the violent chimpanzees as to the sharing bonobos that are the only other species except for us that uses sex for pleasure. One thing is for certain: cooperation is what made us the #1 apex predator species of the world. One human vs. one tiger is one well fed tiger. A few humans with tools against a tiger is a dead tiger.

One needs to remember that Capitalism had centuries to mature into the state it is in now - it had bloody revolutions, dictatorships, etc. One can't expect that the communist movement needs to honor ""three strikes &amp; you are out"".

51258,Have any countries or regions announced coronavirus control plans other than quarantine/contact tracing?,"So far the Western nations I'm aware of seem to be trending towards the Chinese/South Korean plan for coronavirus containment:


Lockdown the entire country until the number of new cases is manageable
Introduce localized quarantines and contact tracing to minimize the number of new infections
Wait for the vaccine or cure


However point #3 is risky, as no one is sure if a vaccine can be at all created or if an effective enough cure can be developed. Therefore it might be tempting for some countries to go for an alternative approach in an attempt to balance the risks. Have any countries officially (or at least indirectly) announced such a plan? Some alternative solutions I'm aware of:


""Do nothing"" 
Isolating the elderly, but no general quarantine
Chickenpox style variolation, similar to the pox parties of the past
Maintaining a full lockdown from the world without having the virus locally - 22 countries report this so far


I am aware that the situation is currently evolving around the world, so I expect new answers to trickle in within the next months. 
",52280,"If depends quite a bit what you mean by ""plans other than quarantine"". There are of course efforts to test anti-virals and develop a vaccine. But the amount antivirals available might not suffice in the short run, even if they prove [safe and] effective.

Generally speaking however


  Given the lack of testing in Europe and the US, the only way to keep the sick and healthy apart is to keep everyone apart. And that produces a recession.


And the alternative for that would be to test everyone. It's been done at small scale (you'll be amused where) in Italy, in the very first region hit, i.e. in the town of Vò. But the trouble is that testing capacity doesn't quite scale to the ""test everyone in the country"" presently... except maybe in Iceland, the only country I know of that that is doing random testing on a serious scale (relative to the country's size); but it's worth noting that there's convergence between random testing and the chunk of the population that gets tested in Iceland:


  Iceland has tested a far greater proportion of its population than anywhere else on earth, including South Korea — another country touted for its effective response to the pandemic.
  
  But what makes Iceland unique is that test samples are not only taken from ‘high risk’ individuals who have exhibited symptoms, came into contact with known carriers, or returned from countries such as China and Italy, they are also offered to thousands of ordinary members of its general population, who are nonsymptomatic.


On should not discount the level of quarantines imposed in Iceland either though:


  Across this remote and rugged island nation of a little more than 364,000, as of Friday morning there were almost 10,000 men, women and children — equivalent to 9 million Americans — under this form of state-enforced lock and key.


So it's more like ""more of everything"" being done over there rather than ""alternative plans"".



If by plans you mean plans to relax the lockdowns at some point, every country is probably thinking/considering when they can do that. Economists have been spurred into providing answers to hard-choice questions that need to balance economic damage/recession with the lives saved (in the short run). See e.g.


""Managing economic lockdowns in an epidemic"", or in more depth
""The Macroeconomics of Epidemics"" (Eichenbaum et al.); also covered in (the latter half of a) NYT article.


Alas the experience of Hong Kong last week shows that lockdowns may [need to] return in some cases/areas...



I somehow missed the ""odd man out"", in this case, Bolsonaro:


  In a televised address last week, he repeated a now well-worn phrase. ""It's just a little flu or the sniffles,"" he said, blaming the media once again for the hysteria and panic over Covid-19.
  
  A few days later, he clearly demonstrated his prioritisation of the economy over isolation measures favoured by the rest of the world.
  
  ""People are going to die, I'm sorry,"" he said. ""But we can't stop a car factory because there are traffic accidents.""
  
  ""Jair Bolsonaro is alone right now,"" says Brian Winter, editor-in-chief of the publication Americas Quarterly. ""No other major world leader is denying the severity of this to the extent [...]
  
  A few days ago, a video was shared by Jair Bolsonaro's son, Flavio - a politician himself.
  
  The video's message, which claimed to come from the Brazilian government, was that ""BRAZIL CAN'T STOP"" (in Portuguese, #obrasilnãopodeparar). People need to keep working to keep the country safe and the economy growing.
  
  So much so, in fact, that a federal judge on Saturday banned the government from campaigning against isolation measures. Government posts on social media using the hashtag were hastily removed.
  
  ""He's clearly laying the foundation of being able to say six months to a year from now that he did not agree with tough distancing measures, with the lockdown,"" says Oliver Stuenkel, Associate Professor of International Relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo.


That kind of internal power struggle has happened to some extent in Pakistan too, although the military apparently gained the upper hand and managed to impose some level of lockdowns despite opposition from some politicians and clerics. And Khan (like Bolsonaro) also seems to hedge his bets:


  Prime Minister Imran Khan, however, has appeared out of step with local provincial governments. He had previously said a ""lockdown"" would not be sustainable in Pakistan, as it would cause too much harm to those on low incomes.
  
  After provincial governments went ahead and introduced measures tantamount to a ""lockdown"" anyway, Mr Khan attempted to explain he only opposed what he described as a ""curfew,"" while also outlining some measures to protect the poorest in society, who are dependent on daily wages to feed their families. Unlike other Muslim countries, his government has not ordered an end to congregational prayers on Fridays.

",Reasonable,"Judging by the plenary agenda link that Joe C provided, it seems they're booked next week from Monday to Thursday, and then have nothing planned until the Nov 13th.

At the very least there's a factual error in there. It should read the 13th rather than the 14th.

Further, the MEPs could arguably sit at some point by the end of the month to get this passed -- and I'd wager will, if British MPs pass Johnson's bill.

That said, even if British MPs do pass the bill, I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if MEPs end up looking into the text several days later. Insofar as their reputation goes and insofar as I've seen from watching anecdotal debates, MEPs tend to come very well prepared to debates. Given this, I'd suggest they'd be rather unimpressed with a third party sticking a gun to their faces and trying to get them to vote under pressure. So much so, in fact, that  I could totally imagine Verhofstadt pushing to get some kind of language in the coming extension so that, if they're not done deciding themselves, it kicks in even if British MPs end up passing Johnson's deal at the last minute.

On the flip side, you can safely bet that MEPs as a group are well prepared for the coming bill already, and continuing to prepare. This has a long history in fact. Barnier has been explaining what his team has been doing every single week since the whole thing began, and their negotiation strategy was out in the open for everyone to read. As such, and in stark contrast with British MPs, who had no idea of what was going on or of what was heading their way until the last minute agreement was passed, with only a few days to go through the thing and conduct an analysis of whether they like it, MEP aides who were following the topic had, if not the word for word legalese, at least a fairly good idea of what was heading their way already.

(Just to be clear, no one is expecting that MEPs passing the Johnson deal will be anything other than a formality. I'm merely suggesting that they will do their due diligence regardless.)



Edit: I reached out to the Guardian article's author for further thoughts. He's suggesting that MEPs won't sit again after the 24th, but didn't say why. Will update this if/when he does.

He also suggested in a prior article that the EU would accept an extension if asked, and apparently Johnson will send a letter to that effect tonight.

51260,"Are there any surveys in the US on whether ""preserving the American way"" is worth the risk of sacrificing their elderly to COVID-19?","CNBC reported that:


  [Dan] Patrick, the Texas lieutenant governor, said Monday on Fox News, “As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren? And if that is the exchange, I’m all in.”


Apparently on the same show another fairly high profile US politician said


  SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): For a small segment of our population, it's true, the coronavirus can kill you. For a small segment.
  
  But you know what else can kill you? Poverty. Hunger. Losing the entire economy.
  
  And we need to stop thinking about the next election and try to think a little more about the next generation and what we leave to them, which is going to be the little end of nothing if we let this economy collapse.


According to CNN (which alas doesn't link to the actual polls they mention):


  The often-dismissive messaging from Fox News hosts was notable, given that the viewers who make up the network's audience skew older and are thus more vulnerable to the disease.
  
  Polls from both Gallup and Pew Research revealed that Republicans — who are largely distrustful of mainstream news organizations and primarily turn to Fox News and other right-wing sources for information on current events — were much less likely to take the risks of the coronavirus as seriously as their Democratic counterparts.


Of course, this being a rather emotionally charged judgement, it probably matters a lot how one phrases such a question/choice. Still, I want to know if there any surveys in the US on how much the public sees the mortality risk posed by COVID-19 (which as we know is most elevated for the elderly) as acceptable in balance with preserving the ""American way of life"", ""keeping America great"", or some other equivalently formulated socioeconomic normality [for the US]?



Before I get anymore downvotes, please note that I'm not endorsing those views... but they do exist in various shapes, e.g.


  As fears of COVID-19 spread, so too have ageist messages suggesting that the coronavirus is a disease of the old, with internet memes referring to the virus as a ‘boomer remover.’ 


On the less frivolous side, the NYT has an article [sub]titled: ""Shutdown Spotlights Economic Cost of Saving Lives. President Trump and others have asked if halting normal life and commerce to fight the coronavirus is worth the cost. Here’s how economists figure it. [...]


  “Economists should be doing this cost-benefit analysis,” said Walter Scheidel, an economic historian at Stanford University. “Why is nobody putting some numbers on the economic costs of a monthlong or a yearlong shutdown against the lives saved? The whole discipline is well equipped for it. But there is some reluctance for people to stick their neck out.”


(For more on economics aspects of the crisis, see this econ SE question.)

So I think I'm well justified in asking this question, i.e. how widespread such views might be, especially when it comes to making a [hard] choice.
",51262,"In the most recent polls I found (and there are a helluva lot of polls on coronavirus in the US) from March 26:


  About seven-in-ten adults (71%) say that to address the coronavirus, it is necessary to require most businesses other than grocery stores or pharmacies to close. A larger share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (81%) than Republicans and GOP leaners (61%) view this requirement as necessary.


So most are (now) approving of not-business-as-usual measures to combat the epidemic. Actually, a bit later, this Pew poll details the public response to a few more specific measures, although this is aftery had been anounced/implemented:



As some [polling] pundits predicted a week ago after commenting on those old-by-now polls (of March 20 or so):


  Pew shows that 59% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the ""outbreak is a major threat to the health of the U.S. population as a whole,"" while only 33% of Republicans and Republican leaners agree.
  
  It is certainly possible that this significant partisan gap in views of the coronavirus situation will narrow in the weeks ahead. Partisans take cues from the statements of their leaders, and Trump and other Republican politicians initially were publicly skeptical of the significance of the virus, in some instances claiming that it reflected a partisan effort by Democrats and ""the media"" to criticize Trump. Now, Trump and his allies have begun to move away from that previous posture and are at the forefront of proclaiming the seriousness of the crisis. As media observers have noted, this in turn has brought about shifts in the tone of the coverage by Fox News, and these shifts may narrow the partisanship gap in the days and weeks to come if rank-and-file Republicans follow the cues given by their favored thought leaders.

",Reasonable,"EU membership is based on treaties so in principle the successor state would still be a member (and France certainly remained a member of the EC after the independence of Algeria…). Any other state would need to be admitted to the EU if not through the regular accession procedure, at least through some ad hoc agreement with all current members.

But in reality, such a break-up would be such a momentous event that it would certainly be handled at highest level, in the European Council, on a case-by-case basis. And if all members agree, it's always possible to find some sort of solution, if needed by amending the treaties or creating new ones (cf. everything that has been done during the ongoing Euro crisis). The rest does not matter all that much.

And therein lies the rub: Some current members, first and foremost Spain, are very hostile to giving EU membership for breakaway regions, for fear of bolstering similar movements in their own country. Case in point, Mariano Rajoy, Spain's current prime minister repeatedly stated publicly that Spain would not allow Scotland to remain in the union in case it became independent and did it again last week. That means that even the regular route to membership could be closed in such a scenario (current members can basically veto a candidacy indefinitely, like Greece and Bulgaria are doing to Macedonia over the name of the country).

  Trump's pro-economy death-permissive stance during the COVID-19 crisis


What are the facts backing this claim?
",52277,"I can't speak for Rebecca's judgement in interpreting those words of Trump, but for instance a NYT article says:


  “Our people want to return to work,” Mr. Trump declared Tuesday on Twitter, adding, “THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM!”
  
  In essence, he was raising an issue that economists have long grappled with: How can a society assess the trade-off between economic well-being and health? [...]
  
  “We put a lot of weight on saving lives,” said Casey Mulligan, a University of Chicago economist who spent a year as chief economist on Mr. Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. “But it’s not the only consideration. That’s why we don’t shut down the economy every flu season. They’re ignoring the costs of what they’re doing. They also have very little clue how many lives they’re saving.” [...]
  
  “Making people poorer has health consequences as well,” said Kip Viscusi, an economist at Vanderbilt University who has spent his career using economic techniques to assess the costs and benefits of government regulations.
  
  Jobless people sometimes commit suicide. The poor are likelier to die if they get sick. Mr. Viscusi estimates that across the population, every loss of income of $100 million in the economy causes one additional death.
  
  Government agencies calculate these trade-offs regularly. The Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, has established a cost of about $9.5 million per life saved as a benchmark for determining whether to clean up a toxic waste site.
  
  Other agencies use similar values to assess whether to invest in reducing accidents at an intersection or to tighten safety standards in a workplace. The Department of Agriculture has a calculator to estimate the economic costs — medical care, premature deaths, productivity loss from nonfatal cases — of food-borne disease.


So, the argument [in there] is that governments always make such trade-offs/choices, whether they are incredibly open about them or less so.



I should also mention (here, in case comments get purged again) that the NYT article discusses in a bit more depth the finer points of balancing the economic losses from lockdowns with those that would occur in an unchecked epidemic. This topic has been a addressed in some recent economics publications, e.g. Eichenbaum et al. discussed in the NYT article; but see also a simpler ""lockdowns 101 economics"". For the broader economic aspects of the crisis see also ""The Economics of Coronavirus"" on Econ SE.

I would understand the argument that it violates the equal protection of the 14th amendment; however, if the practice is done uniformly and nondiscriminatory within the state, it should be fine.
SCOTUS refused to hear a case involving the Nevada election ballot. The ballot contains an option for ""None of the Above."" In 1998, Harry Reid won re-election over then Republican Rep. John Ensign by 428 votes while more than 8,000 voters rejected both men and opted for ""none."" Clearly this unique ballot affected the race, and the nation (Reid is the Senate Majority Leader today).

EDIT: Pursuant to the comment below:
The 15th amendment says that the right to vote cannot be denied due to race. The 19th amendment gave woman the right to vote. The 24th amendment prohibits poll taxes. And the 26th amendment gives 18 years old the right to vote. Any election law must be compliant with these amendments.
As for the SCOTUS case: At the district court level, the court ruled the option to be unconstitutional; however, at the appeal level, the judge threw out the lawsuit and issued an emergency stay which allowed the option to stay on the ballot. I have not found any resource that explains the Supreme Courts decision not to hear the case.
 Some background about the case: The Republican National Committee (RNC) challenged the law because if ""None of these Candidates"" received the majority of votes, it could not win the election and hold office. The Nevada Attorney General counter argued that the option was a form of protest and a offered the same outcome as someone who did not vote.

a 47% approval rating

However he has also had the lowest approval ratings of any president on average, never once having had an approval rate of more than 50%, and averaging around 43%. The last few weeks is the first time since March 2017 his approval has been higher than his disapproval.

Also all leaders have been polling better in this crisis, and most have been polling much higher than Trump . In a Fox News poll:


  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health; local officials got 75 per cent; state governments 74 per cent; Vice-President Mike Pence 55 per cent; and Trump 51 per cent.
  
  The federal and provincial governments in Canada are getting high marks for their handling of the crisis, with approval ratings mainly in the 60s...France's unpopular president, Emmanuel Macron, has gotten a bounce, with polls showing him gaining as much as 14 per cent during the crisis. Italy's governing party is polling better, too.


A high approval in a crisis does not mean re-election.


  Take George H.W. Bush, who had an approval rating around 90 per cent after winning the first Gulf War in 1991 but lost re-election the following year. A soft economy quickly pulled his Gallup approval down as low as 29 per cent.

52306,Has the WHO said anything about travel restrictions since the end of February?,"The WHO was against travel restrictions as they detailed in a press release at the end of February. But in the month past (March) practically every country on earth has instituted travel restrictions, most recently China, which is now afraid of being reinfected from abroad.

So, has the WHO changed their public stance in any way about travel restrictions by now? I searched a bit, but it seems they've gone mum on the topic of travel, while (of course) strongly advocating for social distancing in general. (Aside: the WHO wants us to use ""physical distancing"" as the more appropriate term for that.)

I haven't done anything like a survey on this, but clearly some governments include ""minimize travel"" in the physical distantincing advice they give, e.g. Australia's 


  Government advice for implementing physical distancing has mainly urged people to isolate themselves in space: staying at least 1.5 metres apart, working from home, avoiding gatherings, and minimising travel.


So maybe the WHO has done the same somewhere in their recommendations and I've missed it.

Likewise, there have been at least three (high-profile) publications in Science this month on this:


March 6


  the travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but has a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.

March 25


  It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.

March 31


  The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29). [...] This analysis provided no evidence that the prohibition of travel between cities, which was implemented after and in addition to the Wuhan shutdown on 23 January, reduced the number of cases in other cities across China. These results are robust to the choice of statistical regression model. [It also analyzes, and finds effective (via association), most city-level social-distancing measures:] Our model suggests that, without the Wuhan travel ban or the national emergency response, there would have been 744,000 (± 156,000) confirmed COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan by 19 February, day 50 of the epidemic. With the Wuhan travel ban alone, this number would have decreased to 202,000 (± 10,000) cases. With the national emergency response alone (without the Wuhan travel ban), the number of cases would have decreased to 199,000 (± 8500). Thus, neither of these interventions would, on their own, have reversed the rise in incidence by 19 February. But together and interactively, these control measures offer an explanation of why the rise in incidence was halted and reversed, limiting the number of confirmed cases reported to 29,839 (fitted model estimate 28,000 ± 1400 cases), 96% fewer than expected in the absence of interventions.



So maybe there's a ""wind of change"" in the scientific community on this, maybe not, but perhaps it's too early to tell what the consensus might become on this. So I'm ""holding off"" on accepting the answer below for now (based on a non-mention in a March 11 WHO statement) as rather inconclusive.
",52307,"The WHO released a joined statement with the ICAO ([on the WHO website it's dated 11 March 2020). It does not mention travel restrictions directly. It does, however, stress cooperation at different levels, for example between ""aviation and health authorities"". 

My interpretation is that the WHO is leaving such restrictions up to the states, at least in their public statements. 
",Reasonable,"Donald Trump tweeted the following on August 27, 2017:

  ""This determination is not part of a Mexican negotiating strategy, but a principle of national sovereignty and dignity,"" the statement said.


The same article also discusses Trump's suggestion that the US withdraw from NAFTA and Mexico's response:


  Mexico said its position at the negotiating table was ""serious and constructive"" and sought a winning result for Mexico, the US and Canada.
  
  ""Mexico will not negotiate NAFTA nor any other aspect of the bilateral relationship through social media or the media,"" the ministry added.


More recently (December 19, 2018), Trump has claimed that Mexico would be paying for the wall via a new trade treaty:


  Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall!


However, both NPR and PolitiFact fact-checked this claim and found it unsupported by the available evidence.

52321,What sustainable options do poorer non-first world countries have against COVID-19?,"In wealthy first-world countries, although social distancing hurts on a social and economic basis, it is at least feasible for a certain time. Basically every country world-wide has now implemented such measures. 

Reports from outside the first-world, however, make it seem like this is a much more challenging policy to implement. Police in South Africa are firing rubber bullets at shoppers who are violating lockdown and in India there are literally millions on the march home despite the country's lockdown order. Staying at home and keeping distance is impossible in slums with huts and no running water. Furthermore, poor people also much less able to survive a period without income and poorer countries are less able to provide them with support during this period.

Is there good evidence whether or not current lockdown/social distancing measures are sustainable in poorer third-world countries? If not, are there any other options for such countries to fight global pandemic that can be sustained and enforced?  
",52343,"In many ""poorer non-first world countries"" it's going to be very challenging. People often need to work every day in order to ""eat"" the next day, which prohibits social distancing measures. They have a problem with the availability of sanitation - for hand cleaning. The density of the population in some of these countries is also very significant, which can provide an additional risk factor for a greater spread of the virus.

From past epidemics for example in sub-Saharan Africa, they needed a lot of mostly international humanitarian help. Medical systems in poor countries usually have little capacity to deal with a huge number of cases. They also don't have a way for effective testing for the virus, laboratories... The question is to what extent can humanitarian help be made available.  

""Rich countries"" and international organizations providing governance, medicine, and other resources are currently in the core of epidemics themselves. This crisis is also economically challenging, which adds prohibitive cost to invest in humanitarian help for poorer countries. IMF is currently planning to lend around $1trn to developing countries, and hopefully, G20 will also provide at least some humanitarian capacity to help them. From a political point of perspective, China can use this as an opportunity to extend its influence over developing economies requiring help with fighting Covid virus.

Prohibitive measures could also be used by some of the political regimes to tighten their grip on power which could lead to destabilization.

",Reasonable,"The 3% deficit floor and the 60% Debt-to-GDP ratio were part of the Euro convergence criteria of the Treaty on European Union (Maastricht Treaty).

The framework is developed in Article 104c, with the specifics left to the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure.

As to where these limits came from, Luigi L. Pasinetti states in The myth (or folly) of the 3% deficit/GDP Maastricht ‘parameter’:


  Nobody has ever been able to give any plausible explanation of why
  these two figures were chosen.  As  far  as  the  60%  ratio  is 
  concerned,  the  most  likely  inference  is  that  it  amounted  to
  roughly  the    average  observed    in  Europe  at  the  time  of 
  the  drawing  up  of  the  Treaty,  with  both Germany and France
  being near it. But other countries (notably Belgium and Italy) were
  far from it; and since it would have been unreasonable (in fact
  impossible) to require immediate adjustment, a proviso  was added
  (art.104c) stating that a higher Debt/GDP ratio than the “reference”
  one would be acceptable if  “the ratio is sufficiently
  diminishing”.
  
  More  difficult  to  explain  is  the  choice  of  the 
  3%  public  Deficit/GDP  “reference  value”, especially  if  one 
  considers  that,  on  this  point,  the  Treaty  is  now  being 
  interpreted  very  strictly, allowing for absolutely no deviation (not
  even by any small fraction of a percentage point) from the 3% figure.
  Such a rigid stance is so extraordinary as to lead one to think that
  any justification can only be found in the realm of symbolism. The
  whole of the Maastricht Treaty seems to have been reduced to the
  fulfilment of this symbolic figure of a 3% public Deficit/GDP ratio
  stated in one of its  Annexes.  But  even  symbols  cannot  escape 
  the  reality  of  their  implications.  If  a  3%  public Deficit/GDP 
  ratio  is  to  be  rigidly  adhered  to  and  regarded  as  a  symbol 
  of    European  fiscal  and financial stability (even at the cost of
  heavy sacrifices), it surely should be an absolutely necessary
  condition for fiscal and financial stability.
  
  Nobody  has  ever  proved  this.  In  fact  it  cannot  be  proved,

52322,Why have some governments banned outbound international flights in response to COVID-19?,"Why have some governments banned outbound international flights in response to COVID-19?

For example, the Philippines initially announced (but later reversed) a ban on outbound flights:


  Airports in Luzon [large island in Philippines where the capital, Manila, is located] will stop all outbound international flights starting Friday after the government gave a 72-hour window to all those who wish to leave the country after heightened measures were put in place to control the spread of COVID-19.
  
  https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/3/17/Philippines-international-flights-coronavirus-Luzon-quarantine.html


The New York Times has an article on travel bans that identifies a few other cases of countries with outbound travel bans, including:


Namibia: ""suspending inbound and outbound flights from Qatar, Ethiopia and Germany for 30 days""
Bolivia: ""cessation of all flights to and from Europe""
Peru: ""The measure means all international flights will be canceled. ""


I understand the ban of inbound international flights to prevent contaminated individuals from entering the country, but banning outbound flights seems less obvious to me.
",52326,"Another possibility, ignoring fears of infection, is that the country doesn't want their citizens to become stranded in another country if flights are suspended at a later date. For example, on Monday, March 30th, the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced a £75m plan to charter flights to repatriate stranded Britons, and also advised any citizens still in countries where commercial flights remain available to fly home as soon as possible.

If a country's citizens become stranded abroad it will usually end up being the government's responsibility to fly them home.
",Reasonable,"As you rightly mentioned in your question, arguments in favour of majority government is that they tend to last much longer, bringing with it an element of stability. Whether you support the party in power or not, a majority government brings with it a clear sense of what to expect for a particular mandate period. In the Canadian political system, some argue that majorities are not healthy because it lacks a system of checks and balances (like the US system) and gives the prime minister and his or her government virtually the power to do almost anything they want throughout their time in office. A united opposition would be unable to prevent government measures from passing. Good if you support the governing party; not so good if your political views or priorities are not aligned with the government. 

Minority governments are interesting because they compel the governing party (which is usually the party with a plurality of seats in the House of Commons) to find common ground with one or more opposition parties. This forces upon elected officials to communicate and collaborate on the issues and to pass laws which, ideally, would benefit a larger swath of the population. 

The downside to minority governments are many; however. First of all, with a shelf life averaging just over 2 years, there is a cost to the taxpayer in terms of the frequency of general elections. For example, since 2001, Canada has seen elections in 2004 (Martin minority), 2006 (Harper minority), 2008 (Harper minority), 2011 (Harper majority) and 2015 (Trudeau majority). Each election comes with a $375-million price-tag, with the 2015 election roughly double that amount as it was the longest election period in Canadian history. 

The other downside is that minority governments often get defeated trying to accomplish the very things they set out to do in the electoral platform. Electing a minority government doesn't give the public a sense of predictability about what the government may do, because they require support from the opposition who come with their own demands. Political platforms are essentially invalid with a minority government either because they don't have the support to fulfill those promises, no time to complete them (being defeated before passing anything they've promised) or fulfilling part of their promises with some alterations proposed by opposition parties.  

Another element to minority governments in recent Canadian elections is the changing of political party leaders. The Liberals have gone through 6 party leaders since 2006 (including interim leaders); The Progressive Conservatives went through this kind of phase after the Joe Clark government was defeated, and again when the Reform Party was established. When you combine party leadership ballots and the volatility of minority governments, it can really give someone the sense of a continuous, never-ending election cycle. 

Which is better? It really all depends on what you value in our political system. Do you want collaboration over certainty? Do you want predictability or the power to remove an incompetent government?

52353,To what degree are safety standards relaxed when a FDA Emergency Use Authorization takes the place of an FDA approval?,"It is generally assumed that an FDA approval is conditioned on the demonstrated safety and effectiveness of a product. However, when the FDA authorizes the use of a product due to an emergency condition, does that mean that there is no requirement to demonstrate safety and effectiveness?

Presumably the FDA has some regulatory threshold between ""not proven safe"" and ""proven safe"" where it issues emergency use authorizations. So, to what degree are safety standards relaxed when an FDA Emergency Use Authorization is used in lieu of a standard FDA approval?

Second question: while it is obviously that the relaxation of standards is influenced by the severity of the emergency, but does that relaxation threshold also vary with political and or corporate pressures? 
",52367,"Looking on the FDA website, I found this: 

Notice of Declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID-19

In brief, it lays out that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is offering limited immunity from lawsuits and prosecution — at his considered discretion — for medicines and equipment to be used against the Covid-19 pandemic. It allows approved equipment and medicines to be used in 'off-label' or unapproved ways, and allows drugs that are being researched under 'investigative' exemptions, or even drugs or products that the Secretary decides could reasonably be on the market within 10 years (meaning drugs that are early in development, and not yet thoroughly tested). The FDA is still holding the reigns — it has the final say in determining that a drug or device is at least marginally safe — but it is setting aside the exhaustive testing and approval processes it normally requires before allowing general use.

Section IV to VI spell out what is and is not covered by this immunity during the Crisis, but it seems the standard being used is that the drug or device has a credible purpose in dealing with some aspect of Covid-19 and is not grossly or flagrantly irresponsible to use.
",Reasonable,"If you are a diehard Republican, you may be tempted to vote in a Democratic primary in order to boost one of their candidates that you believe may have a more difficult time during the general election than the other.  I have had republican friends telling me they keep cheering Bernie Sanders on, because in their perspective he will have a harder time getting elected than Hillary Clinton, for example.  This would be a bigger deal in election years where one party has a contested primary and the other one doesn't (meaning there's not too much of a reason for people to go vote in one of them, so why not vote in the other?). This happens generally every other presidential election cycle, since a president who can run for another term generally does so with their party's support.

Besides this fear of crossover voters 'stealing' the primary away from people who actually are in the party, one bonus purported from here is that a closed primary tends to let candidates talk more openly about their views during the primary since they are largely just speaking to their base.  This could let the party know more about the attitude of their base by seeing which candidates get better reactions from the issues they choose to support.  It should be noted that some look to this as one of the failings of the closed primary; politicians should stand for issues that are good for all of their constituents, not just those in their own party.

You hear pundits talk about the general election 'pivot' because of this, and why I'm not sure you can really take anything anyone says at face value during a primary election anyway.  Of course, as that link states, there's not much stopping me from changing party affiliation at any time and voting in whatever primary I choose.  ""Ultimately, the parties must trust voters.""

Lastly, here's a quote from Bernie Sanders printed by the NYTimes that points out in a closed primary, people who choose not to affiliate get left out:


  “Today, three million people in the state of New York who are Independents have lost their right to vote in the Democratic and Republican primaries,” Mr. Sanders said standing alongside Mr. Cantalupo. “That’s wrong. You’re paying for this election. It’s administered by the state. You have a right to vote. That’s a very unfortunate thing which I hope will change.”


In my home state, the primary election is semi-closed, meaning independents can choose to vote in either the democratic or republican primaries.  The only catch is that, if there's a run-off in either, you can only vote in the run-off for the primary that you actually voted in.

(See, for example, here: https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-viktor-orban-rule-by-decree/)

The main argument is that:


The bill allows prime minister Orban to rule by decree infinitely (at least as long as he sees fit) and that
There is no real need for these measures even during the current COVID-19 pandemic.


But what remains is the question whether there is any need for such measures. From my view as a outsider, I can't really see any benefits concerning the fight against the pandemic. Fidesz already has a two-third majority in parliament, enabling it to rule mostly unhindered and is even  able to change the constitution if deemed necessary. Any (tough) measures could probably be passed easily by Fidesz without Orbán having to be able to rule by decree.

Of course, if someone would like to transform the country into a dictatorship, these measures would make a lot of sense. But are there other reasons that may justify the necessity of the bill?
",52368,"Well, one obvious justification is that it means the parliament does not have to assemble. 


It is difficult to organize a parliamentary debate while keeping social distancing.
What if some legislators get into contact with an infected person. Could they still speak and cast their vote, or would they be banned during the quarantine period?


Of course the parliament could e.g. have put a narrow expiry date on the rules, but who knows how feasible a session would be three or six months from now? An expiry of ""after the pandemic"" would be too fuzzy. 



My personal opinion is that the parliament should have found a way to stay relevant, but the question asked for possible justifications.

An option might have been to change parliamentary rules to reduce the quorum, possibly combined with pairing, or to allow online debates and voting, but those are difficult for democracy as well.
",Reasonable,"WTO rules are much less favourable than the deal that the UK currently has with the EU. There would be mandatory tariffs in both directions, forcing up prices. The UK would lose things like EU certifications for aircraft and vehicles too.

WTO rules are designed to be a minimum level on which countries trade, only used in the absence of better deals.

There are also problems with the WTO rules themselves. For a start they require equal treatment for all countries operating under them, and given that the Irish border must remain open it's a problem for both the UK and EU. The EU would not want an open border with a WTO-rules country because it would be obliged to offer the same to all other WTO-rules countries, as would the UK. That threatens peace in Ireland and both economies.

Finally, it's not clear that the UK can actually trade on WTO rules as freely as some people claim. Other members have already lodged complaints over the UK's allocation of EU quotas, and in the event of a no-deal crash out would doubtless lodge more over the open border with Ireland. Disputes in the WTO take years to resolve and can be used as leverage to get trade deals less favourable to the UK.

52399,Why is there no randomized testing of general population for coronavirus?,"Decision on how long to keep the economy ""shut down"" depends on the evaluation of how deadly/infectious coronavirus is. 

So I would assume that countries would try to test random members of ""healthy""(no sign of illness) population to determine the spread in the population.

I assume this was not done because tests are in high demand for people that exhibit symptoms, but could not find any confirmation for my thesis.

There is this question from 3 weeks ago, but from what I understand no answer claims there is a generalized sampling.
",52403,"This may seem counterintuitive, but constructing and administering a properly random testing paradigm is difficult and time-consuming. It's not as though we can gather everyone in a big room, put their names in a hat, and then call them out one-by-one to get tested. There are a number of different issues that need to be resolved, e.g.:


People are not randomly distributed. In the real world they cluster by race, religion, economic status, political affiliation, occupation, and other demographic factors. A purely random sample (unless it's immense) will likely underrepresent or overrepresent specific populations.
People are not easy to find. Say that Joe Smith is someone randomly chosen to be tested. What if we can't reach him by phone or email? What if we send a testing kit to him and he neglects to return it, or uses the kit incorrectly? What if we send a 'swabber' to his house, only to find he isn't home, or refuses to open the door? Depending on methodology, sampling in this context can have massive non-participation, and the more non-participants we see, the weaker our statistical results are.
People are not infected entirely randomly. Infections are a Markov chain, where one must be in specific kinds of contact with an infected person to have a chance of being infected, and then (if infected) must be in the same specific kinds of contact with uninfected people to pass it on. Modeling a Markov chain as though it were purely random misses important aspects of the way a disease is spread, and will skew results badly.
Perhaps most importantly, the spread of a pandemic is a fluid situation, not a stable characteristic of individuals. Collecting physical samples from people requires a tremendous amount of time and labor (driving to a home and collecting a sample, driving to another home and collecting a sample, repeat, repeat, drive back to homes where people were absent and try again). Even if we could muster a veritable army of 'swabbers' for our random sampling of nearly 400 million people, we can expect the actually swabbing to take at least a week (generously), and in a week the number of infections has doubled and doubled again. The first people swabbed are not being drawn from the same statistical population as the last people swabbed, and our statistics will suffer. And then we have to ask about our swabbers, who are all part of the population we are sampling, and all of whom have been exposed to large numbers of potentially infected people...


The upshot is that if we were to take the time to properly construct and implement a large-scale random sample, the disease would be spreading while we were designing the methodology, the disease would be spreading while we were implementing the testing, and by the time we finished running the data we collected the disease would have spread further, making our results all but useless. I'm not saying they would be entirely useless — with appropriate statistical manipulations we can account for many of these issues — but whatever use it has will be for future epidemiologists looking back on this pandemic.
",Reasonable,"As you indicate, we will ultimately need to wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in on such a question, but some analysis of our own can lead to a reasonable understanding of the argument that might be made.  

First, the only the thing that the Constitution actually says about the selection and voting of the state's electors is the following in Article II, Section 1, Clause 2:


  Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof
  may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of
  Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the
  Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an
  Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed
  an Elector.


The key point of this statement is that the electors shall be appointed in a manner the state's legislature deems fit, not by some national or Constitutional standard.  As a result, many of the types of laws you highlight are going to be given a fair bit of leniency from the Supreme Court.  In fact, almost all election law in the United States is state law and that is why we see elections being carried out so differently from state to state with the state's Secretary of State presiding over and certifying elections.

52414,Who was responsible for deciding the CDC would produce all COVID-19 tests instead of immediately opening up test production to the private sector?,"FactCheck.org considers Trumps claim that he inherited a broken CDC system to be 'misleading', and has given a long description of why they  made that ruling.  It effectively boils down to the claim that the CDC was never intended to be the sole producer of tests.  Instead they claim that the CDC was always intended to work with third parties and private sector to support the production of tests and other resources if a pandemic happened, and that the delays with testing was due to the CDC not allowing private sector agencies to build tests originally.

If it's true that the intent of the CDC was to support/regulate private sector test development, and that the CDC failed to do that, then the next question is why didn't it?  Why did the CDC not immediately open up production of tests to the private sector and support and vet those tests as factcheck.org claims was the original design intent?

Is there a specific individual or group of individuals who had the ability to decide to open up testing to private sector and failed to do it?  Was Trump or the white house in any way responsible for this decision to not open up testing to the private sector?

",Reasonable,"There are two plausible explanations, the first being that they didn't want to contribute to further splitting the Remain-voting bloc, and the other being that they couldn't find a candidate in time.

To provide context to the situation alluded to in the question; originally the main Remain-supporting parties, the Greens, the Lib Dems, Renew, and Change UK had all planned to stand down their individual candidates and back an independent, pro-Remain candidate. This was decided on Tuesday the 7th of May, two days before the deadline to register candidates, to be Femi Oluwole. 

After wrestling with the decision on whether or not to stand for two days, Oluwole eventually decided not to run on the morning of the deadline. The reasons he gave for his refusal were fear of splitting the remain vote, handing victory to the Brexit party, lack of local ties to the area, inability to dedicate enough resources to the by-election while also working on the European elections, and ethical reasons related to his involvement in the Our Future Our Choice campaign which he co-founded. Oluwole threw his support behind the Labour candidate, who had not been involved with the talks to run a unity candidate, and indeed, as the link in the OP says, ""made it clear that they would strenuously disrupt the campaign and obstruct an independent candidate"".

Faced with less than 24 hours to choose candidates to run before the May 9th deadline, it seems that Change UK either failed to find a candidate willing to stand for the party, or decided that running another pro-Remain candidate would help hand victory to the Brexit party by taking votes from the Labour candidate. Given that the candidate that they ended up supporting in the by-election, Renew's Peter Ward, eventually won just 45 votes, it seems likely that the party had found that their level of local support was negligible, and therefore that running a candidate would be wasteful, given the upcoming European elections. It is also possible, given that in April, Renew announced that they would support Change UK in the European elections, that there was some sort of private deal between the parties to trade support and pool resources.

In conclusion, then, it seems that while there is a lack of clarity surrounding this decision, and certainly no official explanation of their decision-making process besides wanting to avoid splitting the vote, by reading between the lines somewhat we can identify most of the factors that will most likely have influenced the decision.

52419,Why is the lack of seasonal agricultural workers considered a problem given the high unemployment rate in every Western country?,"Currently farmers in Western countries are warning governments that without foreign workers their fields will be impossible to harvest:


  “We are in need of a lot of foreign workers,” Eystein Ruud, a greenhouse farm owner and chairman of the Norwegian Horticultural Association, told The Globe and Mail. “If we cannot get these workers in the coming weeks, our farmers won’t risk putting a lot of plants in the soil. That may affect the food supply.”


At the same time Western nations are about to face unprecedented levels of unemployment due to the COVID-related shutdowns. On the face of it, this seems like a perfect match - people who lost their jobs could now work their local fields, earning a salary and supplying much needed food for the nation. So why is this considered a problem, rather than a blessing in disguise? Shouldn't governments be happy they have job openings for the unemployed?

I do understand that working the fields is difficult and only young people could do it, but currently a lot of young people lack a job too, so that looks like a manageable problem.
",52421,"I think these countries are in fact approaching this as a problem that has an obvious solution, as you suggest. The issue lies, however, with convincing their populace to work these seasonal jobs, and the inherent nature of seasonal agricultural work.

Firstly, the levels of unemployment are not necessarily going to be as bad as you might think, at least in some countries. Many western countries, including Norway, which you mention, and later, the UK, have implemented schemes which will allow companies to keep employees who have been furloughed due to the crisis on the payroll by covering a large portion of their wages. These schemes don't stop claimants from taking another job, at least in the UK's case, but potentially reduce the need for them to do so.

Secondly, the nature of this work means that for this to be a long-term job choice, workers need to be flexible and able to travel around the country. The BBC points out that 


  One reason overseas workers are recruited for these picking roles is
  that farmers require temporary, flexible workers who will move around
  the country following the crops.
  It is often difficult for local people to fill these roles as they are
  extremely busy for a short space of time - for example, two months to
  pick apples - with no work for the rest of the year.


So while it might be easy to find workers in one area of the country, it is currently infeasible given the COVID-19 crisis for workers to travel around the country as previously. Therefore, a much larger number of local workers need to be found in order to meet with local demand, rather than smaller groups of seasonal workers meeting the demand nationally.

Additionally, western Europeans are unused to this sort of work. According to the Independent:


  It's fair to say that British workers have turned their noses up at
  seasonal farm work in recent years, perhaps partly due to the
  availability of other, more secure jobs in more comfortable
  surroundings.
  
  ""It's hard work and the Eastern Europeans are experienced at what they
  do,"" says Oliver Shooter, owner of AE Lenton, which runs a group of
  farms between Skegness and Boston in Lincolnshire, the centre of
  England's vegetable production.
  
  ""It's not rocket science but it is quite a skilled job that these guys
  do,"" he says. A top picker needs to know and apply supermarkets'
  exacting standards for exactly how fruit and veg must look, as well as
  how to cut it and pack it. For that they'll earn £12 an hour if
  they're good. Many farms also provide free or subsidised
  accommodation.


The seasonal workers that farms usually rely on, that know their trade and are experienced are unable to be used, so farmers are again being forced to engage a larger workforce than normal, in order to achieve a similar standard of work. This will, of course, entail higher costs, a longer training period, and presumably, a lower yield as mistakes are made.

Governments are trying to deal with this problem by pushing the solution you suggest - the Independent reports again:


  So acute is the need that the government is reportedly readying its
  own ""Pick for Britain"" campaign taking inspiration from the Land Army
  that tilled the fields during the Second World War.


In Norway, the government has introduced a scheme which will encourage employees laid off by their employer to work in agricultural roles:


  New legislation means that if a worker is laid off and takes up an
  agricultural role, he or she will be able to earn both a salary from
  the farmer as well as half his or her unemployment benefit.


It's not so much that the solution to the problem isn't obvious, it's that due to a combination of the nature of seasonal agricultural work, and the complications introduced by the current crisis, the problem is harder to solve than at first glance.

52446,Can an EU country government force its medical doctors work with SARS-CoV2 infected patients without the proper equipment?,"Romania has virtually the worst public health system in EU and there is no surprise that it is far from being prepared for tackling the coronavirus infection.

On major issue is that corruption (e.g. among hospital managers) has led to hospitals to not have the minimum equipment (masks, gloves) not even for a week or two. 

In this context lots of medical workers got infected and quite a lot decided to quit. The government wants to tackle this issue by either withdrawing their right to practice medicine or expanding their notice period.

Since Romania already has a significant medical staff deficit, the second option is more likely. Currently the law mentions a 20 working days period notice (~ 1 month), but the government is considering 60 working days (~ 3 months). Based on some epidemic spreading simulations this will cover the worst period of the epidemics. This means de facto forcing the medical staff to face the infection without proper equipment.

Working without proper equipment means a much higher chance of getting infected, infecting colleagues and patients.

There was a lot of debate over this issue and I am wondering if such measures are compatible with EU laws or the emergency sate can simply override some EU laws that have priority over national laws. 

Question: Can an EU country government force its medical doctors work with SARS-CoV2 infected patients without the proper equipment?

Note: Some equipment was indeed received very recently, a few weeks after the first coronavirus case was officially confirmed in Romania.
",52546,"The EU directives and regulations with respect to ""Workplaces, equipment, signs and personal protective equipment"" can be found here. The directive that I think is most relevant is Directive 89/656/EEC - use of personal protective equipment.

This directive sets minimum standards for PPE used by workers, and states the obligations that employers have on this matter:


  Personal protective equipment must be used when the risks cannot be
  avoided or sufficiently limited by technical means of collective
  protection or procedures of work organization.
  
  All personal protective equipment must:
  
  
  be appropriate for the risks involved, without itself leading to any increased risk
  correspond to existing conditions at the workplace
  take account of ergonomic requirements and the worker's state of health
  fit the wearer correctly after any necessary adjustment.
  
  
  The employer must provide the appropriate equipment free of charge and
  must ensure that it is in good working order and hygienic condition.


When defining what this directive covers, the following exceptions are noted:


  The definition in paragraph 1 excludes:
  
  (a) ordinary working clothes and uniforms not specifically designed to
  protect the safety and health of the worker;
  
  (b) equipment used by emergency and rescue services;
  
  (c) personal protective equipment worn or used by the military, the
  police and other public order agencies;
  
  (d) personal protective equipment for means of road transport;
  
  (e) sports equipment;
  
  (f) self-defence or deterrent equipment;

None of these exceptions would seem to cover medical workers except the rather non-specific ""emergency and rescue services"". I would take that to mean paramedics, ambulance staff, and mountain rescue workers and the like, however it is possible that this clause could be used to exempt general medical workers from this protection.

Specifically in the case of Romania, this directive has been implemented in national law by ""Hotărâre privind cerinţele minime de securitate şi sănătate pentru utilizarea de către lucrători a echipamentelor individuale de protecţie la locul de muncă"", or ""Decision concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use by workers of personal protective equipment at the workplace"". From my rudimentary translation of the law, this appears to be pretty much word for word a translation of the original directive.

At first glance then, it seems that failing to provide adequate PPE for hospital staff is a breach of the employer's obligations under this EU directive. However, there are a number of exceptions noted in the directive, not to mention exceptions in national law, which could be used to exclude hospital workers from the protection. In addition, a few national governments have not implemented the directive into national law yet. This makes it difficult to give a definitive answer before this is tested in the courts, as a Spanish doctor's union is attempting.
",Reasonable,"Rent for new buildings isn't capped (at least not by this new law), so the cap shouldn't interfere with new buildings. Rent may also be increased up to a point when a building is modernized.

The cap was implemented because the market didn't work for a lot of people who needed to spend more and more of their income on rent or be driven out of Berlin. The market also failed to build an adequate amount of new housing before the cap (fewer housing than needed for new residents were build, and the city actually build 25% of new housing itself). Experience has also shown that the market reacts to new buildings not with lower, but with increased rent. And despite the high need for affordable apartments, there was a high amount of vacancy. Because of this, the cap was very popular among voters (over 70% approval).

52468,Why do governments downplay or cover-up pandemics in their early stages?,"CONTEXT

While no government wants there to be a pandemic, and would certainly prefer (hope) for it to just go away, they can only downplay it for a short time before it overwhelms the population and they must address it from a significantly weaker position than if they had acted decisively at the beginning.

In the smartphone era, information propagates instantly through informal networks (Facebook, WeChat, StackExchange, etc.) and is difficult to suppress.

QUESTIONS

After witnessing the COVID epidemic and failure to contain it in Asia, it spread to Europe and was poised to infect the west. Why did western hemisphere leaders downplay the pandemic’s threat instead of acknowledging the problem and communicating what would be done to reverse the issue?  What is the political incentive for deferring acknowledgement and action?
",52469,"In hindsight it's clear that many governments should have taken the risk of a Covid19 pandemic much more seriously, but it's not that easy to anticipate the reach and intensity of the epidemic before it happens. There have been other serious threats before for which the containment strategy proved sufficient, and if a government allocates resources (for instance massive purchases of masks and ventilators) which end up wasted they are going to be criticized as well. 

This article in the Guardian argues that most European countries were not as well prepared as some Asian countries because:


There was no recent experience of a serious epidemic in the country,
causing leaders to subconsciously underestimate the seriousness of
the threat.
There is a potential political cost for a government if they invest
resources by precaution and the risk doesn't materialize:


  ""The challenge faced by government is whether and when to act on a health threat. If you act swiftly and the outbreak isn’t as bad as
  feared, then government gets criticised for overreacting. If you
  adopt a wait-and-see approach and move too slowly, then government
  gets criticised for underreacting,"" says Steve Taylor, professor at
  the University of British Columbia and author of The Psychology of
  Pandemics.


As an example, during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic
Roselyne Bachelot was Minister of Health in the French
government. She purchased 94 million vaccines, but only a small
proportion turned out to be actually used. As a result she was
widely criticized for wasting public money. I assume that there are
other examples of this kind, where a politician loses some political
points because they made a safe but costly decision.


It seems that when an epidemic threat presents itself a government must make a call between:


Taking the threat seriously and therefore mobilizing important resources for an overall unlikely epidemic crisis, with a high risk to appear as overreacting and wasting public money.
Taking minimal conservative measures, which is unlikely to be sufficient if the crisis materializes. However this will likely appear as the ""normal"" choice to make, since nobody could objectively have anticipated the intensity of the crisis.


Note: this answer is made of recycled material from a closed question of mine.
",Reasonable,"
  Why do governments downplay or cover-up pandemics in their early stages?


Because most problems disappear over time, even when nothing is done. So why would anyone enact unpopular measures if there is a chance those are not needed?

SARS, H1N1, Ebola: in all those cases this strategy worked or would have worked. COVID-19 is the exception to the rule.

Politicians who kick the can down the road, will barely ever be held responsible for past mistakes. If some decision turns out to be wrong many years later - a big if - the politician is already in some other role where people don't even know about that past mistake. While the current one responsible will just blame the predecessor. Everyone escapes responsibility in practice.

As a result, ""kicking the can down the road"" is a valid strategy for politicians. In fact, as almost all politicians at the higher levels act that way, it looks like it is requirement to survive the lower tiers.

The uniqueness of COVID-19 is the speed with which inactivity is exposed and punished. The ones who didn't act quick enough two months ago, are still in power.

52507,Is the correlation between the economy and US political outcomes weakening?,"I have heard about the saying “It’s the economy stupid”, but I’m not sure about how true it is now. 

Let’s use Trump’s approval as an example. Even though there is a “rally around the flag effect” that is typical of leaders during crises (it is a lot smaller than governors and foreign leaders and especially President Bush in 2001), it does show that despite the stock market crashing, his approval continued to rise before presumably hitting a ceiling of about 46% on 538. For more context, in the years before, at 538, his approval was hovering at around 43% despite a relatively strong economy. 

I have read that the economy is not affecting people’s voting habits nearly as much as it used to. Is that true?
",52510,"Firstly, to address the example of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its effect on the popularity of Donald Trump; the level of correlation between the performance of the economy and US presidential popularity is well studied. For example, LSE research in 2013 found that presidential approval is highly sensitive to changes in the share index:


  A positive change in the index, when controlling for other relevant
  factors, on average produces an increase in the President’s approval. 
  Interestingly, the effect is even more pronounced when we look at
  market acceleration or deceleration. When the market is growing at an
  increasing rate, voters reward the president, but when growth is
  decelerating, the president is punished.


You are right that President Trump's current opinion polls would seem to buck this trend, as the stock market has plummeted, with the Dow Jones crashing around 8000 points since the end of February, while the President enjoys record high approval ratings of 49% according to Gallup. However, I would argue that instead of an indication that these two measures are no longer intrinsically linked, they are rather an exception to the rule, precedent for which already exists.

We can, for example, consider the performance of the stock market in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, with the NYSE and the Nasdaq closing for almost a week, the Dow Jones falling 14%, and the NYSE market falling by 7.1%, a record at the time. Clearly in normal times, this would have led to a dramatic fall in presidential approval. However, as you note in your question, President Bush's approval rating soared to around 90%, the highest ever for a US president, and would go on to gradually lower over his tenure as President.

Another example might be the Gulf War in 1991. Although this took place in the middle of a recession, which had lowered the approval of President Bush Snr., his victory in the crisis gave him record approval ratings. This lead was, however, squandered over the next year, as Gallup puts it: ""Americans' attention shifted from the Persian Gulf to the struggling U.S. economy"". He would, of course, go on to lose the 1992 election to Bill Clinton.

It seems, therefore, that rather than this incongruency representing a break from the established conventional wisdom that presidential approval, and as a result, US political outcomes, mirrors the stock market, it is at least at the moment a reflection of previous examples of the 'rally around the flag' effect that you note in your question. Whether or not Trump's approval rating continues to stay at this high level will depend on how his response to the crisis is judged by the American public.

Secondly, to evaluate the scope of your question more generally, there is a growing body of research which seems to support your notion that the aforementioned link between the performance of the economy and the electoral outcomes of incumbent politicians is becoming weaker, at least in the US. 

For example, the NYT conducted a survey (notably before the current pandemic) weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States, in which public opinion regarding Trump's handling of the economy was tested. The full results can be found here. Their analysis suggests that:


  Economic conditions have historically been among the best predictors
  of presidential elections, and models based on those patterns suggest
  that Mr. Trump would be favored to win re-election if the economy
  remains more or less on its current path through Election Day. But it
  is unclear whether historical lessons hold in an era of heightened
  partisanship.


In particular, SurveyMonkey, who conducted the poll, note that


  When asked which political party in general does a better job handling
  the economy, the public is locked in a 45-45 deadlock. Republicans
  overwhelmingly (95%) favor the Republican party, while Democrats
  overwhelmingly (88%) favor the Democratic party. Independents are
  split, with 39% favoring the Democrats and 36% favoring the
  Republicans.


It would seem according to this research, that although ""Jobs and the economy"" remains the most important issue for the largest proportion (24%) of the survey participants, their other partisan beliefs are unlikely to shake their party loyalty in the wake of a change in economic fortunes.

In addition, 538 has a great article on this, which I won't go into too much detail on because this answer is already pretty long, but in particular, Silver notes that:


  In particular, we don’t have enough data to make overly specific
  claims about the economy. That is, any time you see what you might
  call a “magic bullet” claim, such as that second-quarter GDP is
  crucial or that per-capita disposable income is the key economic
  variable, you should be wary.


Although he also echoes the misgivings of the NYT article, that partisanship could dull the response to a recession, he maintains that the performance of the economy is still very important to the outcome for the incumbent party - ""The better off America is by November, the more likely he is to be re-elected.""

In conclusion, then, although there is evidence to suggest that the conventional link between the economy and the fate of incumbent officials is weakening due to increased polarization and partisanship, the link is still undeniably extant. While in this specific case around the COVID-19 pandemic the incongruency can perhaps be explained by the 'rally 'round the flag' effect, it seems likely that the ultimate fate of Trump's 2020 campaign will be defined by his response to the pandemic and the underlying economical issues over the coming months. It is still far too early, in my opinion, to write off our conventional knowledge based on a few opinion polls conducted during a crisis.
",Reasonable,"The state of the economy is a strong indicator for political outcomes because the economy is persistent in people's minds. Wars come and go, crises come and go, pandemics come and go, but the economy is always there in the background, and it's what people always return to worry about when more dramatic worries fade in their minds.

Trump presents an unusual case in US politics for two (interconnected) reasons. First, and most obviously, Trump's entire political strategy is the creation of a continuous stream of mini-crises: endless insults, attacks, and divisive speech; sudden policy reversals or spontaneous 'gut' decisions that throw planning and preparation into disarray; bald-faced lies and misstatements that create conflict and distrust; etc. This has the effect of keeping the populace in a state of constant distracted agitation that makes that natural return to concerns about economic policy difficult. Combine this continuous agitation with Trump's patronizing and self-aggrandizing assertions that 'his' economy is the 'best ever', and that may be sufficient to mute the kinds of economic problems that ultimately sank W and HW Bush's approval rating.

Second — and this is a bit more abstract and philosophical — Trump is the titular leader of what Madison referred to as a 'faction' (see: Federalist #10), but a faction on a scale we have not yet encountered in US history. In Madison's words, a faction is:


  [...] a number of citizens, whether amounting to
  a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by
  some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights
  of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the
  community.


This 'common impulse of passion' — which in the case of Trumpism I think of as neo-colonial exceptionalism: the idea that the 'perfect union' of the original colonists has been disrupted by 'outsiders' (brown people, Jews and Muslims, Leftists, feminists...) — is an overriding factor that (thus far) has kept Trump's approval rating from dropping below the mid-30's regardless of actual government outcomes. Whether that deep factional base will survive pandemic deaths and the collapse of the economy remains to be seen, but it is a force to be reckoned with.

The economy is still, and always will be, a significant factor in political life. At the end of the day, and after every crisis, people are going to worry about their mortgages, their social standing, the food on their table and the money in their bank accounts. That will never change. The political question, however, is whether and to what extent other supervening factors can be leveraged for political advantage over and above that economic given.

  Is there any international travel rule which prohibits a country from refusing entry to its own citizens?


Yes.


  The Right of return  is a principle in international law which guarantees everyone's right of voluntary return to or re-enter their country of origin or of citizenship. 
  
  The right is formulated in several modern treaties and conventions, most notably in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 1948 Fourth Geneva Convention. The Geneva Conventions, it has been argued, have passed into customary international law and that the right of return is binding on non-signatories to the conventions




The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights says


  Article 13.
  
  (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.
  (2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.

",Reasonable,"The United States (US) only has two parties because of the way that presidential elections work.  In general, plurality voting systems lead to two parties.  You can read more about why at Duverger's law.  The basic idea is that plurality voting forces voters to choose which governing coalition should win the district before voting and the presidency is basically a national district.  

In other systems, voters have more ability to choose parties that represent them better.  In the US, they have to vote for atypical members of their parties, e.g. Blue Dog Democrats or Main Street Republicans.  In many other systems, those would be different parties.  The Congressional Black Caucus and Tea Party might also have been separate parties in other countries.  

The United Kingdom (UK) can have more than two parties because it is a parliamentary system (although still with plurality voting).  So while each district only has one or two serious parties, different districts can have different pairs.  Because the country as a whole has multiple parties, it is easier for the pairs to change in a district.  This helps avoid the stabilization into a two party system.  Note that it is still dominated by two parties.  Either Labour or the Tories are always in the governing coalition and have been since the demise of the Liberal party.  

In the last general election, the Tories used the promise of a referendum to keep the party from splitting into pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit factions.  One can view the pro-Brexit faction as having some similarity to the Tea Party movement in the US.  The Scottish National Party has some similarities to the Congressional Black Caucus.  It votes almost exclusively with Labour (vs. the Tories), but in the UK, it is a separate party rather than a Labour faction.  

Since 1996, New Zealand has had a form of proportional representation.  Proportional representation encourages multiple parties as it is easier for small parties to get enough votes for representation.  People can choose a party that represents almost all of their beliefs.  The parties then choose a governing coalition that makes reasonable compromises.  Parties that don't support enough of the governing coalition's agenda join the opposition instead.  

New Zealand is not the only country with proportional representation.  It's actually rather common.  And in general, those countries have multiple parties in both the governing coalition and the opposition.

  In Massachusetts a bill was passed in response to the death of Senator Edward Kennedy and his request that the current law be changed.  Previous law in Massachusetts called for a special election to be held, but not until five months after the vacancy occurs.

https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vacancies-in-the-united-states-senate.aspx

In 2004, to prevent the Republican Governor from appointing a Republican, the Democrat legislature passed laws which mandated a special election.  However in 2009, when Ted Kennedy died, there was a desire that the post should be filled promptly, and the law was amended so that the Governor could make an interim appointment.

The timings are further complicated by the postponement of elections due to COVID-19 restrictions.  However it seems reasonably clear that 


The Governor can only appoint an interim senator.
The Governor cannot be overruled by the legislature, but the legislature can amend the law before the Governor makes their choice.
The timing of the special election is about 5 months after the post falls vacant.

",Reasonable,"
In countries where human rights are applied, they are, as you say, ""core"" values. So ""core"" that, when they are applied, it makes no sense / gives no useful information just to say that you are ""pro-human rights parties"".

Imagine the USA Democratic or Republican party running an ad saying that they are against slavery, or people being put in jail without due process. At best, it is time wasted because it will neither report to the voters any new information nor remark any difference against the other political parties. At worst, the public will be confused as why the party feels they need to make such a pointless statement (imagine Obama addressing the nation to state that he is against using the CIA to kill Republican politicans).
In countries were human rights are not applied, there are usually parties that try to promote them. Note that in many cases, they will not defend them collectively, but rather the individual rights. This is useful because:


people will understand more easily ""freedom of association"" than a more abstract ""human rights"".
""Human rights"" as a label may be seen as an external politic guideline (decided by a few countries), strange to the country culture (for example, Chinese officials often claims that the concept of the Human Rights is the product of Western culture and not appliable to Chinese politics. Defending particular rights is a way to bypass that affirmation and focus in the actual rights being demanded.
Some countries may be receptive to some Human Rights and not to others, for example maybe Saudi Arabia is more receptive to allowing association rights than, say, religious freedom or women's rights. Even people who are in favour of all the ""Human rights"" may chose to demand only those that are realistic demands.
And last but not least, in many countries without Human Rights, demanding the Government to change its polices is heavily prosecuted, both legally and illegally.

52590,"What was WHO's defence from US Republican attacks that the WHO ""really blew"" their response to the pandemic by being ""slow"" and ""deceptive""?","As reported on the BBC today:


  The [US] president accused the WHO of being ""very China-centric"" and said they ""really blew"" their pandemic response.
  
  Dr Tedros has now dismissed the comments, insisting: ""We are close to every nation, we are colour-blind.""
  
  After first attacking the WHO on Tuesday, President Trump renewed his criticism at his press briefing on Wednesday, saying the organization must ""get its priorities right"". He said the US would conduct a study to decide whether the US would continue paying contributions [...]
  
  On Tuesday, President Trump had said the WHO appeared to be ""very biased toward China"".
  
  ""They called it wrong. They really - they missed the call,"" he said. ""And we're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We're going to put a very powerful hold on it, and we're going to see.""


Clearly (from the same article) Tedros has rejected the notion that the WHO has a China-bias, but have they said anything more specifically rejecting the other accusations, i.e. that they ""really blew"" their response and that they ""missed the call"" (when the pandemic started)?

Similarly,


  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Trump, vowed there would not be any funding for the WHO in the next Senate appropriations bill.
  
  ""I'm in charge of the appropriations subcommittee. I'm not going to support funding the WHO under its current leadership. They've been deceptive, they've been slow, and they've been Chinese apologists,"" Graham said in an interview with Fox News.
  
  Last week, Republican Senator Marco Rubio called for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saying ""he allowed Beijing to use the WHO to mislead the global community"".


These latter accusations from Republican senators are even more direct and specific (than ""blew""), accusing the WHO of deliberate deception, in cahoots with Beijing, besides being ""slow"".

Thanks to @ItalianPhilosophers for finding this, Fox News has been emphasizing this bit in their coverage of the Republican-WHO spat:


  Last month, Taiwan accused the WHO of ignoring a warning it sent in December about human-to-human transmission of coronavirus. “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China,” the organization tweeted in January.


Which may be what the US Republicans are alluding to with ""slow"".

Somewhat more obvious/predictible, Fox News is critical of the WHO's criticism of the US travel ban:


  the WHO responded to Trump’s travel ban on foreign nationals coming from China by saying that “travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation” of coronavirus cases and instead could have a “have a significant economic and social impact.”
  
  Criticism of the travel ban and other pro-China statements have brought renewed questions about the U.S. funding the agency.


(The latter issue has been the topic of two separate questions here e.g., so I don't want to reash that.)

If the WHO itself has not replied to those (other) allegations of Trump/Republicans/Fox-News/Taiwan more specifically, has the WHO's record in this respect been defended by others, e.g. has the press said anything in support/defence of WHO's actions in response to the pandemic that can address some of Trump's accusations (from those quotes that I have emphasized)?
",52593,"For what's worth it, Al Jazeera quoted a third-party defence of the WHO:


  Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, said the last thing the US and the WHO need right now is this sort of a fight.
  
  ""It is a distraction from the need to focus on defeating this pandemic,"" he told Al Jazeera.
  
  ""No virus has a nationality and it is down to how the countries have handled the threat. The core information that was needed to understand this risk was available by the end of January - and it was available through the WHO. That information still is very accurate in terms of transmissibility and lethality of this disease, so that really should have been all for any country to take it seriously,"" Konyndyk said.
  
  ""In general, I think the WHO has been further ahead of the curve and understanding the risk of the virus than Trump's own administration has, so I don't think WHO is to be blamed for the US's sluggish response."" 


And also added this on their own:


  The WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency on January 30, nearly a month before Trump tweeted: ""The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA,"" and a full 43 days before he declared a national emergency in the US.


I'll accept a better answer in the sense that I asked in the question, i.e. if the WHO themselves explicitly defended their record/actions in response to those Republican accusations.



Similarly the Guardian has an article defending the WHO with extensive quotes from experts and among those they've quoted a WHO official too  (Lawrence Gostin):


  WHO’s total annual budget is about $2.5bn, and contributions from member states have not significantly increased over three decades.
  
  “The WHO’s budget is around the equivalent of a large US hospital, which is utterly incommensurate with its global responsibilities,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law professor at Georgetown University. [He also holds a WHO position, as made clear later in the article.] “So, if the US president were a global health leader, he’d be leading a call to at minimum double the WHO budget in the face of this pandemic.” [...]
  
  “I have been a longstanding critic and I’ve described their performance on Ebola as catastrophic. But I think overall their performance on this outbreak has been, not perfect, but pretty good,” Ashish Jha, a public health professor at Harvard, said.
  
  “They’ve been very transparent as much as they have known the data. They have had daily calls, they have been very clear about the severity of this illness, and how the global community has to respond.”
  
  Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, took part in WHO conference calls about coronavirus from 7 January, according to sources familiar with the conversations.
  
  Gavin Yamey, the director of Duke University’s center for policy impact in global health, said: “If the United States had followed the WHO’s very clear advice on identifying cases, isolating cases and conducting contact tracing, then it wouldn’t be in the appalling situation that it is in today.”
  
  Despite its declaration, the WHO did not advocate travel restrictions of the sort imposed by Trump a day later on non-American travellers arriving from China. The president has pointed to this as an example of bad advice. But Gostin, who is director of the WHO centre on global health law, said that the organisation cannot generally call for travel bans under international law – and such bans can be counterproductive, leading countries to withhold vital information for fear of economic isolation.
  
  “To blame the WHO for acting on the basis of international law and science in ways that are entirely consistent with what WHO practices have been for decades is the height of hypocrisy,” he said.
  
  Trump claimed that his ban “shut down” intercontinental transmission of the virus, but an ABC television investigation found that there were 3,200 flights from China to the US in the critical period between December and March.


The Guardian article does grant the WHO critics some points on Taiwan:


  The US president’s accusations that the WHO is “China-centric” have more resonance with public health scholars. The WHO has largely excluded Taiwan from its discussions, and dodged questions about the Taiwanese response, which has been one of the most effective. But because of pressure from Beijing – which sees Taiwan as an integral part of its territory and opposes any form of recognition – the blindspot is a UN-wide phenomenon.
  
  “I think the effusive praise for China, in the early days, was probably unnecessary,” Jha said.
  
  Amanda Glassman, the executive vice-president and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said a deeper problem is the WHO’s low budget and relatively toothless structure. Unlike the nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, it has no redress against governments that do not cooperate.
  
  “It operates in countries at the pleasure and permission of the host country governments. So in the case of China, to be allowed to enter China, it was a negotiation to get there,” Glassman said.

",Reasonable,"When a candidate gets a majority in the first round, there is no difference. It is also usually possible to determine that all but the top two candidates did not win, even if it is not possible to immediately determine which of the top two candidates did win in IRV (although it is often possible to make a very good guess about that point based on the similarities and differences of the candidates who remain in the running to those who are eliminated).

When no candidate receives a majority, as in Maine this year where the process was used for the first time, it took three or four extra weeks. But, some of this delay was because the process had to be implemented for the very first time in the history of that system being in place. It would probably be possible to shave a week or two off that time frame if the system were more familiar to election officials from prior use. If electronic voting systems, rather than paper ballots were used, it would have been possible to get the instant runoff result immediately, but that would come with downsides with regard to the degree to which the result could be audited.

This is several weeks shorter than a true runoff election in states like Louisiana and Georgia and California where that is held if no candidate wins a majority.

Of course, races where no one candidate receives a majority aren't all that common, a fair number of close races are delayed for a week or two for a recount because the outcome was very close, WA state results are always delayed for a week or two since ballots can be postmarked on election day and received afterwards, and the cases that result in recounts in FPTP overlap somewhat with races in which no candidate receives a majority. So, the extent to which the process delays the last election result being finally decided is quite a bit shorter. Also, while most constituencies in the U.S. get a result that can be called on election night, a significant minority every year do not because vote counting precedes more quickly in some places than others, so even without significant delays, it almost always takes 2-3 days to get a final result. 

U.S. ballots take much longer than U.K. and Canadian ballots to count, in part, because U.S. ballots typically each include dozens of candidates and issues (from districts that do not have the same boundaries), and all of the constituencies in the U.K. and Canada are fairly small (and similar in size) compared to an entire U.S. state, a U.S. Congressional District, or a large U.S. county like Los Angeles (with 10.16 million people), while U.K. and Canadian ballots typically involve only a single candidate race on each ballot. Also, election administration in the U.S. is much more fragmented administratively with many more or less independent bodies handling this task.

The last election for Congress in the 2018 election that was decided, in NC where there was election fraud by Republican operatives in excess of the GOP margin of victory wasn't resolved in time for anyone from that seat to be elected by January 3, 2019 when everyone else was sworn in this year.

Thus, it is also important to distinguish between cases where the determination of which party received a majority of the legislative body are delayed v. cases where the determination of the exact extent to which the leading party or coalition has a majority is at stake. Unless the overall national outcome is almost perfectly 50-50, delays from counting non-majority races won't prevent the public from knowing which party will be in control of a body within 2-3 days.

52602,When did the WHO decide there was evidence of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19?,"A January 14 WHO tweet that has been widely re-broadcast months later by the right-wing US press (e.g. NYPost, WashExam but not exclusively by them, e.g. Bloomberg opinion piece, Politico o.p.) said that:


  Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.


The WHO is lampooned for this moment by the aforementioned media pieces, but these don't really say when the WHO came to a different conclusion regarding human-to-human transmission. So when did that happen, and what information source did the WHO use for the latter determination?
",52604,"The WHO was clearly wary that human-to-human transmission may be a factor at the beginning of January - although their initial Disease Outbreak News (DON) of January 5th entitled ""Pneumonia of unknown cause – China"" states that:


  According to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or
  vendors in the Huanan Seafood market. Based on the preliminary
  information from the Chinese investigation team, no evidence of
  significant human-to-human transmission and no health care worker
  infections have been reported.


They also note that all patients are being isolated, and that close contacts of patients are being identified and monitored, which indicates that this avenue was being investigated.

Further advice published on 10th January also indicated that:


  From the currently available information, preliminary investigation
  suggests that there is no significant human-to-human transmission, and
  no infections among health care workers have occurred.


But again, warned that travellers should take measures such as


  
  avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections;
  frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment;
  travellers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes
  with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
  


According to the WHO COVID-19 Timeline's entry for January 14th:


  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove noted in a press briefing there had been
  limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus (in the 41
  confirmed cases), mainly through family members, and that there was a
  risk of a possible wider outbreak. Dr. Kerkhove noted that
  human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our
  experience with SARS, MERS and other respiratory pathogens.


After WHO officials from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan from the 20th-21st of Jan, the latter office published a twitter thread on January 21st stating that as a result of the increasing number of cases of the virus; ""It is now very clear [...] that there is at least some human-to-human transmission of #nCoV2019"". The thread also states that ""more information and analysis are needed on this new virus to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission and other important details"". 

Additionally, on the 21st of January, the DON for the spread of the disease in the Republic of Korea contained the phrase ""the extent of human-to-human transmission"", the first DON not to question the existence of human-to-human transmission, but rather its extent.

A more formal announcement was made by the WHO mission to China on the 22nd of January which states that:


  Data collected through detailed epidemiological investigation and
  through the deployment of the new test kit nationally suggests that
  human-to-human transmission is taking place in Wuhan. More analysis of
  the epidemiological data is needed to understand the full extent of
  human-to-human transmission. WHO stands ready to provide support to
  China to conduct further detailed analysis.


In conclusion then, while human-to-human transmission was suspected to be present from the initial WHO DON on January 5th, this was not confirmed until after data observed in the field in Wuhan by members of the WHO China &amp; Western Pacific regional offices was thought to show that human-to-human transmission was clearly a factor. These field investigations took place on the 20th-21st of January, and announcements acknowledging this conclusion were first made on the 21st.
",Reasonable,"Background

H.R.5325 was a continuing resolution to fund the government from October 1, 2016, through December 9, 2016.

On September 22, 2016, in the Senate, S.Amdt.5082 (aka SA 5082) was proposed to amend H.R.5325.

Sen. McConnell, the majority leader, proposed SA 5083 through SA 5089.


  SA 5083. This Act shall take effect 1 day after the date of enactment.
  
  SA 5084. Strike ‘‘1 day’’ and insert ‘‘2 days’’.
  
  SA 5085. This Act shall take effect 3 days after the date of enactment.
  
  SA 5086. Strike ‘‘3 days’’ and insert ‘‘4 days’’.
  
  SA 5087. This Act shall take effect 5 days after the date of enactment.
  
  SA 5088. Strike ‘‘5’’ and insert ‘‘6’’. 
  
  SA 5089. Strike ‘‘6’’ and insert ‘‘7’’. 


Immediately following this series of amendments, Sen. McConnell called for cloture to end debate. The cloture vote was taken on September 27, 2016. It failed 45 - 55.

Additional amendments were considered; then on the 28th, SA 5082 passed, whereupon, Sen.McConnell withdrew, by unanimous consent, his prior amendments from September 22nd.



Questions


  Why were these amendments introduced to H.R. 5325 in this manner?
  
  Is there a reason why this series of amendments were introduced like this?
  
  Could an enactment date not be changed with one amendment or does it have to go through increments like this?
  
  Is it a tactic to stall similar to quorum calls to allow for additional time to work on this bill?




Answer

The Legislative Process on the Senate Floor: An Introduction, p 11.


  Majority leaders of the Senate have sometimes offered a series of amendments, one immediately after another, taking up available slots for pending amendments for the purpose of “freezing” the amendment process so that no other amendments can be offered (except by unanimous consent) at that time.




It should be noted that had SA 5082 failed completely, it would have required reconsideration of H.R.5325. In that case, Sen. Reid, the minority leader, had nine amendments ready (SA 5094 - SA 5102), apparently, to prevent Senators from introducing other amendments to H.R.5325.

52628,Why did some US institutions not migrate their very old software systems to use somewhat newer ones?,"This article shows us that some US institutions rely on very old systems (written decades ago, which is very long in IT time perspective):


  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy says that the state is looking for
  volunteers with skills that can be used to help in the COVID-19
  coronavirus outbreak, and one of those skills is knowing your way
  around a 61-year-old programming language used on big, old, mainframe
  computers. 
  
  COBOL is an old computer programming language that was first developed
  in the 1950′s in conjunction with the Department of Defense. Today,
  most programmers prefer and use more modern languages, but there are
  pockets where old software written in COBOL remains in use,
  particularly financial applications and in large enterprises or
  government agencies.


I understand that state institutions are typically much slower that private companies when it comes to IT investments, but having such old systems seems strange. Relying on systems written so much time ago incurs lots of issues which translates to wasted time and money:


initial developments done way before modern software development frameworks were around us
it is much harder to find specialists which know the language, but also are able to adapt to such an old software development style
inability to act in a timely fashion when changes or maintenance must be performed (e.g. Coronavirus outbreak)


It makes for banks to be reluctant to rewriting their systems due to big costs and risks, since they must also make profit. But a public institution is not profit based and in theory can easier invest in modernizing their software systems.

Question: Why did some US institutions not migrate their very old software systems to use somewhat newer ones?

Note: I am not thinking about big leaps, but at least to work with languages and frameworks that are at most 20 years old, not 60 years old. 



While the main arguments are related to software development risks, I am interested in the political aspect of the ""why"", since we are talking about public institutions making the decision to partially / totally rewrite some systems. Such aspects might be related to the size of projects or quality of management in the public sector.
",52630,"It's not just US institutions, there are many countries, institutions - including banks - and companies running on ancient software and hardware.

There are multiple reasons for that:

First, from the business standpoint, replacing software costs money. Why spend money to replace something that already meets requirements? If you have software A that does what you want, already exists and is ""free"", since you already own it, and software B, which doesn't exist yet, costs years of development time, probably requires new hardware and has the associated costs for all of that, which would your boss or your (often very much non-technical) boss
's boss approve? What would a government employee with a tight budget approve? What would a politician calling for less government spending approve?

Secondly, the exact workings of the system are often lost in time. No one actually knows what the system does exactly, but it interfaces with dozens of other systems through APIs that are equally unknown, obscure or deprecated. Creating a specification for such a system that a contractor/contracted company can work with is difficult, if not impossible. There is a huge risk that the resulting system will not replicate the behavior of the old system and stuff will stop working. It might do things like round .5 up instead of rounding to even like the old system, which could cause all the bills or transactions to suddenly be off by 1 cent compared to the previous system.
In government, a broken system could mean that the unemployed might not get their benefits, the tax payers not their yearly tax payback or any number of things that will lead to an elected politician not being reelected. Politicians like being reelected, so even if they understand the technical need, which is rare anyways, they might avoid the risks for political reasons. Often there were attempts at replacing the system, which then failed and then those failures get pointed at whenever someone proposes replacing the system.

Thirdly, the old systems usually have a very bad user interface. A new system will have a shiny, new interface, sometimes because creating the old interface wouldn't even be feasible in a new application. This requires training people. People that have worked in the company or institution for 40-50 years and are very set in their ways. Those people often have a lot of blocking power, which can completely halt development on the new system, because their requirements, i.e. ""don't change anything,"" aren't met. They are usually also very hard to fire and replace, so the institution has to hire new people without firing them, which requires a bigger budget, which comes back to the first point.

In summary, as technical people we might understand that those systems will someday inevitably go ""poof"" and everything will break down catastrophically. Other people either don't know that it can happen, or they just hope that it will happen after their time, because in the end no one wants to pay the money, take the risk and take the blame for a project that will probably fail.
",Reasonable,"Why do you think that just because a programming language is old, that programs are inferior to those written with new languages? I'm reminded of the case of Ster-Kinekor, a local film house that in 2014 decided to redesign a perfectly operational online booking system because someone told the IT manager that Flash is dead.

Millions of rands later they eventually got a far worse system than the original for a fortune, going on to very nearly bankrupt a completely functioning company with hundreds if not thousands of employees, for no better reason than some IT person's hubris.

You don't redesign functioning software unless there is a really good reason.

  As Greece enters its third week since restrictive measures were first

  that fatigue is setting in amid signs of people beginning to flout the
  policies.
  
  Speaking to ANT1 TV, the government spokesman Stelios Petsas said the
  centre-right administration was now considering placing a time limit
  on the movement of citizens outdoors, the Guardian reports.


Are there any polls which attempt to track how much people are content with staying under lockdown?
",52637,"The day after lockdown measures were implemented in the UK, YouGov conducted a poll of 2788 adults testing whether they supported or opposed the imposition of the measures.

They found that 76% of respondents strongly supported the measures, 17% somewhat supported them, and only a combined 4% opposed them in any way.

Just over two weeks later, on April 9th, they conducted another poll which asked respondents whether they would support or oppose lockdown restrictions being extended further than the initial three week period.

It found that while strength of support may have dropped slightly, the public was still overwhelmingly in favour of an extended lockdown, and that any drop in support was fairly negligible - combined opposition was found to be 5%, with combined support at 91%.

Indeed, YouGov has also found that at least in one part of the UK, respondents think that the lockdown doesn't go far enough - a poll published on April 10th that surveyed adults in Wales found that a majority (53%) thought that the lockdown measures should be tightened, with only 6% thinking that the measures should be relaxed.

I think we can conclude from this that although there may be a small amount of quarantine fatigue given the slight drop in strength of support for the lockdown measures between March 24th and April 9th, the public still remains overwhelmingly content with the measures at the moment, and there is evidence that at least one constituent country of the UK may support a tightening of the lockdown measures.
",Reasonable,"
  Why than do Republicans continue to cut these programs?


For the same reason Willie Sutton robbed banks.  That's where the money is.  

From Politifact, percent of federal spending:  


  
  25.3% Social Security
  28% Health (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.)
  16.2% Defense
  4% Veterans
  4% Food and Agriculture (including food stamps)
  4% Transportation
  3% Education
  2% International Affairs
  13% everything else (including welfare)
  


So between them Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other health spending make up 53% of the budget, and that percentage is growing.  

Even though Social Security and Medicare have specific taxes to fund them, those taxes don't actually fully fund the programs.  Both programs spent more than they received during the last recession.  Absent another recession, they might fund themselves through 2021.  The trust funds would be depleted entirely around 2034.  

Medicaid does not have its own taxes, so it is always paid out of the general fund.  

By contrast, Defense, Veterans, and International Affairs are only 22%, less than either Social Security or health alone.  And Republicans tend to be of the opinion that Defense is underfunded.  

The other alternative is to increase taxes, and the Republicans are against increasing taxes.  Since spending is projected to grow, to keep the deficit constant, they have to ""cut"" spending.  Of course, in reality, spending on Social Security and Medicare will continue to rise regardless.  The ""cuts"" are really only slowing the rate of growth from its current projected amount.  

Well, there is one other alternative.  They could increase the retirement age.  That both increases tax revenues from people working longer and decreases spending.  And it does so without increasing the tax rate.  That's essentially what the last bipartisan deficit commission recommended before Barack Obama rejected it.  


  Do they want all three of these programs eliminated completely? 


Perhaps some do, but most want the programs to be self-funded out of the existing set-aside money.  There is currently no one recommending an absolute drop in spending in either Social Security or Medicare.  Both will increase every year under any plan actually proposed in Congress.

52643,How does libertarianism handle contagious diseases or pandemics?,"In libertarianism, each person is responsible for their own health.  Nobody is forced to take health insurance, and a hospital is not obliged to provide care to an individual who cannot pay for the bill (either by themselves, via insurance, or hoping for donations).  If you break your leg and can't pay for treatment, you don't get treatment.

How does the inherently individualistic libertarianism deal with the inherently collective threat of a contagious disease, which may become an epidemic?  If a sick individual is not treated, they may infect hundreds of others.  Quarantining the sick individual against their will goes against individual freedom.  In theory one could argue they may be liable for the medical costs of everyone they infect, but that is not helpful when people don't know who infected them and the infected individual can't afford treatment for hundreds of others.

Most countries deal with this threat by collectively paying for healthcare and drastically reducing the freedom of infected individuals, effectively putting them under house arrest or forcing them into hospital against their will.  Even the freedom of many healthy people is substantially reduced.  What alternatives does libertarianism propose to this, if any?
",52654,"While I haven't found a reference discussing the libertarian approach to pandemics more generally, I did find one about vaccines, which should be relevant enough, because it's another, related ""collective action problem"":


  Libertarianism and collective action: is there a libertarian case for mandatory vaccination?
  
  In his paper ‘A libertarian case for mandatory vaccination’, Jason Brennan argues that even libertarians, who are very averse to coercive measures, should support mandatory vaccination to combat the harmful disease outbreaks that can be caused by non-vaccination. He argues that libertarians should accept the clean hands principle, which would justify mandatory vaccination. The principle states that there is a (sometimes enforceable) moral obligation not to participate in collectively harmful activities. Once libertarians accept the principle, they will be compelled to support mandatory vaccination. In my paper, I argue that the cases Brennan uses to justify this principle are disanalogous to the case of non-vaccination and that they are not compelling to libertarians. The cases Brennan offers can be explained by a libertarian using the individual sufficiency principle: which states that if an individual’s action is sufficient to cause harm, then there is a (sometimes enforceable) moral obligation not to carry out that action. I argue that this principle is more appropriate to Brennan’s examples, and more appealing to the libertarian, than the clean hands principle. In order to get libertarians to accept the clean hands principle, I present a modified version of one of Brennan’s cases that is analogous to the case of non-vaccination. Using this case, I argue that whether the clean hands principle will justify mandatory vaccination is dependent on whether the herd immunity rate in a given population is approaching a threshold after which a collective risk of harm will be imposed onto others.


So, one could say ""libertarians disagree"" [on the exact approach] to such matters based on that discussion. (And it would not be the only thing they disagree about.)

Actually, there is an article in the Telegraph that even says:


  How can libertarians ever support mandatory quarantine and nationwide lockdowns? 
  
  Quite easily, as it happens. I can’t speak for all libertarians (who can?) but I see libertarianism as applied economics. The government should leave businesses alone unless there are demonstrable market failures and it should leave people alone unless they are doing direct harm to others.
  
  In case it is not obvious, infecting somebody with a potentially fatal virus counts as direct harm to others....


I haven't read the rest, but I'm guessing he's going to argue from externalities viewpoint... which according to other libertarians (Ryan Bourne of Cato in this case) is rapid descent on the slippery slope:


  The classic recommended government remedy for this problem is to try to calculate the marginal external costs or benefits associated with a given activity (beyond the private costs or benefits) and implement taxes or subsidies so these externalities are priced in when consumption or production decisions are made. Joseph Stiglitz’s Nobel lecture is a good description of this policy solution.
  
  Given the pervasiveness of externalities, applying this logic consistently and universally would result in an extremely intrusive government.  [...]
  
  The logic of banning or adopting prohibitively high sin taxes, in contrast, is that the optimal consumption level of anything with external costs is zero. This is an absurd principle, albeit one that is regularly espoused. It is common, for example, to hear commentators and policymakers advocate for a zero-carbon economy. The UK government’s recent announcement that it plans to ban all gas and diesel vehicles by the year 2040 is an example of a policy that will almost certainly impose net social costs on society.


So yeah, from this latter ""more"" libertarian viewpoint, how do you account for the fact that infecting others is only a probability, not a certainty?

As an intermission, it would be interesting if the ""father"" of ""paleolibertarianism"" had something concrete to say on this ([the probability] of infection [of others]), but insofar I wasn't able to find out that, but only some imperfect analogies that he made:


  Probably the most widely accepted doctrine within libertarianism is the “nonaggression” principle, which Rothbard uses as the central theme of his book. The “nonaggression” principle states that “no man or group of men may aggress against the person or
  property of anyone else” (27). Thus, slavery was considered to be intrinsically evil because it
  violated property rights, or the right of a person to be secure in themselves. Yelling “Fire!” in a
  crowded theater, Rothbard argues, should not be restricted because free speech is only a relative
  right; rather, it is criminal because it violates the private property rights of others in the theater
  (52). Essentially, he ascribes to the belief that individuals have an absolute right to be secure in
  their persons and goes on to apply it to numerous other aspects of life. Whether it be education,
  roads, courts, foreign policy, or critiquing the ever-popular Keynesian theory of economics,
  Rothbard consistently believes that the rights of the individual are incontrovertible. His beliefs
  are best summed up as follows:
  
  
    And, indeed, what is the State anyway but organized banditry? What is taxation but theft
    on a gigantic, unchecked, scale? What is war but mass murder on a scale impossible by
    private police forces? What is conscription but mass enslavement? Can anyone envision a private police force getting away with a tiny fraction of what States get away with, and
    do habitually, year after year, century after century? (293-294)
  
  
  This argument continues to be the bedrock of radical libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism, as it
  provides a consistent philosophy that can be applied across all aspects of life. Moderate
  libertarian thinkers tend to diverge from Rothbard, however, on the issue of how to implement
  these ideals. Some, like Rothbard, want sweeping change and scoff at others who argue for
  gradualism. Others, however, realize that government is needed in some limited capacity to
  retain order and that the free market has limits.


Actually Lew Rockwell interprets Rothbard for us in the present context:


  The fundamental rule for deciding whether anyone, including the government, is justified in using force to make us do something we don’t want to do is the nonaggression principle (NAP). As Murray put in in “War, Peace, and the State,” “No one may threaten or commit violence (‘aggress’) against another man’s person or property. Violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor.”
  
  You might at first think that you can use the NAP to justify forced quarantines against the coronavirus. Suppose someone had a deadly disease that would always spread to others if he came in contact with them. Probably the person would want to isolate himself and not infect others, but if he refused, wouldn’t the people in danger be justified in isolating him? He is a threat to others, even if he doesn’t intend to harm them. 
  
  Thinking about this case can lead us astray, and here is where Murray can help us most. In his great book The Ethics of Liberty, he says, “It is important to insist, however, that the threat of aggression be palpable, immediate, and direct, in short, that it be embodied in the initiation of an overt act. Any remote or indirect criterion—any ‘risk’ or ‘threat’—is simply an excuse for invasive action by the supposed ‘defender’ against the alleged ‘threat.’” Murray hammers home the point later in the book. He says, “Once one can use force against someone because of his ‘risky’ activities, the sky is the limit, and there is virtually no limit to aggression against the rights of others. Once permit someone’s ‘fear’ of the ‘risky’ activities of others to lead to coercive action, then any tyranny becomes justified.”
  
  When we apply what Murray says to the coronavirus situation, we can answer our question about forced quarantines. People are not threatening others with immediate death by contagion. Rather, if you have the disease, you might pass it on to others. Or you might not. What happens if someone gets the disease is also uncertain.


Bourne (whom one might peg in the less ""paleo"" camp) also comments on the Covid-19 issue as well (on Apr 6):


  the longer lockdowns go on, the more the income losses for businesses and households turn into bankruptcies and defaults, risking a depression. So economists recognise that the costs and benefits of policy will change over time. They will look for ways of maintaining low health risks but at lower economic and social cost than crude shutdowns, recognising this balance changes as the pandemic evolves.
  
  Indeed, once the transmission rate has been brought down and more people recover from the virus, the calculations could change drastically. If I were one of the last 50 people in the whole country to have not yet been infected, I would not expect a destructive national lockdown to protect me. So, clearly, there comes a point when it’s better to relax things from an economic welfare perspective. That could come much sooner than we think.


Interestingly, it still considers a/the notion of welfare to society as a whole as relevant... but in view of how much [herd] immunity there is... which  actually is quite to the similar argument from the opening quote I gave in this answer. 

And it's easy to get sucked into the myriad variation of responses to Covid-19 of US libertarian writers/personalities/politicians (thus make this answer way too long), but I'll mention here anyway that Ron Paul (who ran for president on a Libertarian Party ticket at one point), has called (April 10) for Fauci to be fired because (according to Paul) Fauci infringed on American liberties by overestimating the number of potential deaths from Covid-19.


  ""[...] they made these dire predictions so that they could go ahead and destroy peoples’ civil liberties and spend a lot of money and make up an excuse on why the stock market actually went down — all kinds of things by having this coronavirus event blown way out of proportion,” Mr. Paul said. “He should be fired,” Mr. Paul said about Dr. Fauci. [...]


Personality polemics aside, it seems that in most libertarian discourse the probability of infection (and death) needs to be considered, so it's not too different from how others approach the matter, but perhaps the probability is (subjectively?) ""tuned down"" at least in some US libertarian discourse. However, the most hardcore/paleo libertarians seem to reject that quantines could ever be justified.

First of all, IMHO this question can't be answered objectively, because no court has of yet ruled on whether the practice is legal. 

State court didn't hear any arguments on the topic, since the lawsuit filed by Pontiac had a radically different set of arguments.

Federal circuit court basically threw the issue BACK to the state saying ""we wash our hands off this"", in the best tradition of political actors going back to Pontius Pilate :)





Second of all, House people are officially claiming that no laws or rules were violated (whether they are correct or not is, again, a question that a court has NOT yet answered).

The meat of the issue is, distilled, as follows:


MI state constitution allows some bills to be passed in the Legislature as ""immediate effect"" (I won't bother with the links or quotes - see CJR link below or lawsuit link above for details)
This means the bill takes effect at passage, instead of 90 days later
This requires 2/3ds votes (super-majority) of both houses
The bills were being passed by a so-called ""rising vote"" voting (basically, the speaker guesses how many people voted ""yay"" and that's all she wrote), as opposed to roll call where every member's vote is recorded.
Minority may request a vote to be roll call...
BUTE, apparently, there seems to be some sort of technicality with how the roll call can be requested that basically allows majority to ignore the minority's request (minority must be called on to request... and majority doesn't have to call on them). Gotta LOVE politics.








Third of all, while Maddow tried to make it like some nefarious evil totalitarian power grab by Republicans (even throwing out stats like 90%+ of bills passed that way by Republicans)... subsequent second looks reveals that Democrats... did exactly the same thing. 


  Of the 761 bills passed when the Democrats had control of the House, 744 had “immediate effect.” (quoted by GOP press secretary, but confirmed by Columbia Journalism Review - not exactly a hotbed of conservatism).



For anyone who wants an in-depth and somewhat balanced look at the story, CJR's article seems to be a good starting point (http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/maddow_michigan.php?page=all&amp;print=true)

As @dancek says, the home screen is not configurable, so you will only see average speed for the whole ride, and instant heart rate/cadence rate if you have the sensors.   Time and Distance are counters



This is the screen that shows up when you stop.  The map with track at the top can be displayed full-screen while riding, and if you have planned a route the track is overlaid on the map as well.

Later analysis can be done on the info - here's the link for that ride:
https://www.strava.com/activities/681005599/analysis
Note I had a HRM but no cadence sensor.



This is the RUN view if you're into that kinda sport.

If you have an applewatch there's a thing for that, but I have no experience of this.   It looks like this:





Both of those screenshots show heartrate.   A phone can't do that alone - you need a heartrate sensor.  Phones with ANT+ radios are better than bluetooth sensors because the batteries last for 4-6 months, whereas bluetooth sensors are a much shorter runtime.   Also note, that phones with a ""pulse meter"" are useless for this purpose.





There are ant+ cadence sensors too - often a little box that straps onto a chainstay, and a small magnet on the end of a crankarm that passes near the sensor.



If you want to see your phone while riding that gets messier.  Personally I keep my phone in my pocket with the screen off.

Otherwise you'll need a handlebar mount, or a top tube bag, or both.  Its a good idea to bring a USB battery pack and cable for your phone, because a phone that runs for a day of normal use might only get 2-4 hours of riding time before its flat.

Right-angle USB cables can help organise things too.

66948,COVID bike build 2020 first timer,"I am building my first road bike. I have been an avid biker rider for quite sometime and always thought about getting a road bike, just never got around to it.

Fast forward to now, my neighbor (pro rider) threw his Scott CR1 carbon fiber frame in the dumpster along with a MOST carbon handlebar and Cosmic wheel set.  Now that I acquired all this stuff for free, time to finally build a bike!

My point of this post is first to get some advice on ... where to start? How do I find out what is compatible to this bike from a component group, to putting everything together etc.

I know I won't be able to do everything but I know I can get pretty far then I am planning on taking it to a local guy to do a tuneup before I get her out on the road.

I want to build as tough and reliable as possible on a budget (don't want to spend a ton but want a quality bike). Let me know if anyone can help out with where to get started, also if you have parts for sale or anything or want to trade for something, I am wide open to that as well. Picture is attached, let me know what year as well if anyone knows. 

Thanks David


",66949,"
This frame is about 10 years old (the model was sold for a few years). There is a chance that there's a crack in the carbon fiber, which would be cause for concern. There are services that will perform non-destructive testing, and there are ways to perform inspections at home with somewhat less reliability, but that would be my first concern.
It looks like the bottom bracket is intact. If the bearings turn smoothly, keep them. If not, you'll want to replace them, which would probably be the most complex part of your build. It looks like this bike takes a PF86 bottom bracket (there are numerous standards).
This bike was sold with a Shimano 105 group (possibly other groups as well). 105 has good performance and good value, so you won't go wrong with that. You'll obviously need caliper brakes, not disk, but that's about the only requirement from the options that will be available to you.
It looks like it has a front derailleur braze-on, so you'll need to make sure you get a compatible derailleur.
There are a lot of other options that will be matters of personal taste. Crankarm length, chainring tooth counts, cassette tooth counts, saddle, pedals, bar tape color, etc.
This is not a marketplace or swap meet, so not a good place to find the parts you'll need.

",Reasonable,"
  A quick search, however, shows other colors available to purchase. Concerning ""to be seen"" bicycle lights, should they be avoided?


Yes, they should be avoided.

First, off-colors might not be legal in your area.

Second, and more importantly, no one will know what it is.  If a driver sees a flashing red taillight, or what looks like a normal white headlight, that driver is likely to identify you and your bicycle.  Something like a blue light is likely to evoke a, ""Huh?  What's that?""  Which means most drivers won't treat you like a known entity - something they need to avoid.  

And what do drivers (and cyclists, for that matter) do about things that don't evoke a familiar ""must avoid"" response?  You won't even register as being there.  Think about it - how many random items to you ride past all the time?  Do any of them really register at all?  Trees, mailboxes, plants, fence posts - they don't meet your brain's ""must avoid"" pattern, so you don't react to them at all.

You do not want to be cycling in the dark where you need lights so you're seen and safe, and then do any thing that makes it harder for others to identify you as a bicyclist.

152710,What do countries rely on self-declaration forms at all?,"In light of the coronavirus outbreak centred in Wuhan, many countries have taken steps to either prevent entry or require a quarantine period for arrivals from the affected area. 

Canada relies on arrivals declaring whether or not they have been to Wuhan in the past 14 days. Yes, some people will tell the truth. But some won't. With 2019 nCoV, someone who was in Wuhan the past two weeks can just lie. 

Why don't G8 countries just assume most people will lie and prepare for worst? 
",152714,"I have not heard about any country denying entry or quarantining all travellers from affected areas. Isolation (at home) is recommended for people who have been in the area and present relevant symptoms. Refusing entry wholesale would be a hugely disruptive and largely self-defeating measure: it encourages people to lie, could spread the disease further by making potentially contagious victims stay longer in a public place — the airport — and through another international flight, would make (crucial) collaboration with airlines or affected countries a lot more difficult.

Extending it to all travellers from China (since you don't want to rely on people self-reported itinerary) would be pure madness (and there are already cases reported in Japan and the US… so you might as well shut down international air travel entirely). It also raises the question of returning nationals or third-country citizens, who cannot easily be refused entry and put back on a plane to the affected area.

Consequently, the question is not designed to catch people who try to defeat screening but to inform people who might not otherwise understand they are at risk and make sure they realize this information is relevant. It's more efficient than asking every passenger verbally and helps officials respond appropriately in situations where oral communication might be more difficult. It's also potentially a database you can come back to for contact tracing.

She later posted pictures showing herself dining at what she claimed was a Michelin-starred restaurant in Lyon.The embassy has now confirmed that her symptoms are under control. >The woman left Wuhan - where the new coronavrius emerged late last year - before flights were suspended, but when thermal scanning was in place. 
  
  5) Airport screening after SARS didn’t catch a single case


I don't believe Wuhan coronavirus: Travel bans for diseases like this don’t work - Vox. First, it just quotes past cases, but past performance doesn't predict future. Second, isn't obvious that lowering Wuhan people means lowering risk.  I know banning China flights won't stop every case. 
",152712,"They may do so at some point if the risk is deemed high enough (remember that WHO still doesn’t consider this as a severe enough pandemic at the international level).

However:


Why would they ban flights from all over China, when a majority of the cases are concentrated in a much, much smaller area? Remember that China is quite large. It would be akin to banning travel from all of Europe after an outbreak in a single city.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you consider that the virus has reached many places outside of China, why only ban flights from China rather than any country where there may have been any cases?
Unless all countries coordinate to completely isolate China (or whatever area is considered “infected”), then people will just travel via a third country, so the ban will be ineffective.


The difficult task of the health authorities is to balance reducing the risk that the virus spreads all over while not infringing on the freedoms to travel. They are constantly re-evaluating the risks based on the available info regarding number of cases, incubation period, ease of transmission, mortality rate, etc. It may be the case that this virus, even though new, is just no worse than the flu.

Remember that a travel ban not only could be a problem in terms of freedoms and rights of the affected people (try telling US citizens they can’t return home – the US government would be taken to court before you finished reading this sentence), but it also has a strong impact on the economy, which itself may have severe health repercussions.

There are probably millions of people who catch the flu, and thousand who die from it every year in your country (I know that is the case in mine). Do you think all travel in or out (or even within) yours should be stopped during the winter because of this?

Two cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, and the number of cases in Germany has grown. Moreover, the Coronavirus has now been declared a global health emergency by WHO.

I got a bunch of emails from SOS International and such, on what methodology I should follow to mitigate the risk of getting infected, but none of them addresses the following (hopefully extreme) hypothetical scenario:


  I go to my seat, and I suspect the person next to me (or in neighboring seats) has the Coronavirus related symptoms (high fever, short breath, etc.). How should I react, without being too paranoid? 


Go in the back to secretly communicate that to the flight attendant, and request a seat change? 



Update (Feb 2): I am now in Munich airport, and both pharmacies (before and after security check) have no typical plastic masks (sold-out). They only have some conical-sized ones. The airport does not provide masks (asked in the Information). I advise you to buy a typical plastic mask before coming to the airport.
",152928,"A cabin crewmember here.

This is different from airline to another, and country to another, but I can safely assume there are a lot of similarities when it comes to this, as most of the airlines get the instructions from local Civil Aviation Authorities and local health ministries, both authorities get the information from higher global organizations. 

The airline I work for supplied its fleet recently with a contagious disease kit, which shall be used by the cabin crew once there are signs of an infected passenger. This kit includes masks to be distributed once needed, a disinfectant liquid (the same as in hospitals) to clean surfaces around the sick passenger, gloves, etc. Also, my airline allowed its crewmembers to wear masks if they wish to on flights from/to certain destinations.

As I said, not sure if the same is being followed by other airlines. Regardless of that, you should inform the cabin crew right away, they are in this with you, they will know what to do. These days our mailboxes are being filled with health information and updates regarding this, and because we are exposed more than the average person, we really care about this.

Finally, what you should worry about is the infected people during the incubation period with no symptoms at all (this has been confirmed), they are as contagious with no way of knowing that. People with fever (a common symptom after the virus incubation period) will not be allowed to board. Therefore, it's advised that you follow basic prevention measures, such as washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, wear a mask (N-95 mask), etc.

153131,What are the current travel restrictions on individuals entering the United States from regions affected by Novel Coronavirus?,"This community wiki explains the current restrictions by the United States of America on the entry of individuals who may pose a risk of transmission of the Novel Coronavirus discovered recently in Wuhan City, Hubei, People's Republic of China.
",153132,"This answer currently lists nationwide entry restrictions imposed by the United States federal (national) government. A majority of states as well as counties, municipalities, towns, and cities have imposed entry bans or automatic quarantine-upon-entry orders as well as stay-at-home orders that may prevent your intended travel. This answer cannot index all of these orders, which have slight differences, technicalities, and effective dates that must be consulted to determine if your planned travel activity is allowed under state and local law. NBC News provides a basic overview as of April 5, 2020. Additionally, travelers should be aware that their home countries consulates in the US may not be operating normally.

Under the new rules, all flights carrying at least one non-crew passenger that has been physically present anywhere in mainland China, Iran, the Schengen Area, or the Common Travel Area (UK/Ireland) within the past 14 days must land at one of the following airports:


JFK - New York, NY
ORD - Chicago, IL
SFO - San Francisco, CA
SEA - Seattle/Tacoma, WA
HNL - Honolulu, HI
LAX - Los Angeles, CA
ATL - Atlanta, GA
IAD - Washington, DC


The following airports were added February 3, 2020:


EWR - Newark, NJ
DFW - Dallas/Fort Worth, TX
DTW - Detroit, MI


The following airports were added March 14, 2020:

MIA - Miami, FL


Additionally, such individuals cannot travel to the US at all unless they meet one of these exceptions:


US citizens and nationals
lawful permanent residents (green card holders)
spouses of citizens or LPRs
parents of unmarried citizens/LPRs under 21
siblings of citizens/LPRs, both unmarried and under 21
children, foster children, and adoptees of citizens/LPRs
air and sea crew members
diplomats and foreign officials
those granted exceptions by high-level officials


Upon arrival, such excepted passengers will be subject to public health screenings by US Public Health Service personnel. At a press briefing on Jan. 31, 2020 (transcript), Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced that individuals who have been to Hubei Province in the 14 days preceding entry will be sent to a 14-day quarantine, and individuals who have been to other parts of mainland China in the 14 days preceding entry will self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days at home. This is the first major federal quarantine action since the 1960s.

This action does not affect aliens (immigrants or nonimmigrants) already in the US. It does not cancel or revoke valid visas, though it temporarily prevents their use and may prevent the issuance of new visas in some cases.

Additionally, entering the US through land borders from Canada or Mexico is limited to ""essential travel"":


US citizens and permanent residents returning to the US
Travel for medical purposes
Travel to attend educational institutions
Travel to work in the US
Travel for emergency response and public health purposes
Lawful cross-border trade
Official government or diplomatic travel

Questions and Answers

Does this include only mainland China, or other territories as well? The 14-day rule does not apply the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. It does apply to the disputed province of Tibet. It does not apply to Taiwan, the Republic of China, which is claimed by the People's Republic of China but is not functionally a part of that country.

Does this include British territories as well? The proclamation covering the UK excludes ""overseas territories outside of Europe"". This seems to mean that Gibraltar and the Crown Dependencies are included, but other British territories are excluded.

Do the US-Canada and US-Mexico border restrictions apply to air travel? Not at this time.

When do these restrictions take effect?


For China: February 2, 2020 at 5:00pm EST
For Iran: March 2, 2020 at 5:00pm EST
For the Schengen Area: March 13, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.
For the Common Travel Area: March 16, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.
Land border restrictions: March 20, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.


Where are these regulations found? The Department of Homeland Security has a page on air travel restrictions, a fact sheet, and a list of news and updates. The CDC has a page on procedures for travelers from the affected countries.

The recent extension of restrictions to the Common Travel Area, consisting of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, was announced by US Vice President Pence at a press conference Saturday the 14th. Official regulations have yet to be promulgated.

Regulations on flights arriving in the US needing to be redirected to certain airports, published in the Federal Register:


For China: this document, with additional airports provided in this document
For Iran: this document
For the Schengen Area: this document with additional airports
For the UK and Ireland: this document


The Presidential Proclamations banning entry of certain sub-classes of these individuals:


For China: here
For Iran: here
For the Schengen Area: here
For the UK and Ireland: here


DHS has announcements for the US-Canada and US-Mexico land border restrictions, and the rules can be found in the Federal Register:


For US-Canada land border: this document
For US-Mexico land border: this document


How long will these restrictions last? The restrictions will remain in effect until further notice from the government. With respect to the entry ban specifically, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to advise the President at least every 15 days whether or not the ban should be changed or cancelled. The land border restrictions last until April 20, 11:59pm EDT.

Who made this decision, why, and what is there authority to do so? The Secretary of Homeland Security made the decision to impose new travel restrictions. The Secretary has the legal authority to designate the places at which flights inbound to the US may land for inspection. The Secretary decided that this measure was necessary to prevent serious harm to the national security.

The President has the authority to suspend the entry of aliens into the US as needed for national security. President Trump found that the federal government is incapable of monitoring all of the 14,000 daily travels between China and the US. Therefore, this rule is needed to protect the public health and safety of America.

The CDC has authority to enact quarantines under the Public Health Service Act.

What if I do not comply with these rules? If you lie to officials about your presence in China to avoid the regulations, you could face serious immigration consequences including expedited removal from the country and a permanent inadmissibility in the future. If you attempt to escape quarantine, the government may use lawful force to prevent you from doing so.

153445,KLM canceled a flight from China back to Europe that we had already requested a refund for. Are we entitled to compensation or just refund?,"Due to the coronavirus KLM canceled all flights from China about a week ago. Naturally we are entitled to a full refund. According to European Union air passenger rights, passengers are also entitled to up to €600 Of compensation in the case of a canceled flight. However, we requested a cancellation of our tickets five days before they announced the cancellation of our flight but after it became public that China closed down Wuhan with the risk of other cities. So we wanted to leave as early as we could. KLM had given notice that they offer rebookings and cancellations at that time. 

Are we therefore also entitled to a 600€ refund Or would we have had to first give KLM the chance to offer us an earlier flight before booking a flight with another airline and canceling theirs? Or should we have waited 5 days until they cancelled the flight to be entitled to receive both the refund + compensation?

So in short, what does the compensation depend on? Also, does the corona virus qualify for the airline to waive the compensation penalty because it’s an “extraordinary circumstance” in the legal sense?

Edit: the cancellation &amp; approval of the refund claim of my ticket came into effect yesterday, 5 days after the flight would have taken place. We received no confirmation of cancellation neither for our specific request nor any warning of the airline itself that the flight was cancelled in general. This suggests that they A cancelled our tickets and therefore B didn’t consider us a passenger anymore at the time of cancellation. Still, it’s odd that they never gave us confirmation of the ticket cancellation. Just a “pending approval for refund request” state. 
",153453,"The airline did NOT cancel your flight.  They cancelled a flight that you were not booked on at the time of the cancellation.  It is as simple as this.  You were not booked on the flight, so you are due no compensation.

IF you had not already canceled your tickets, and you were still booked on the flight at the time of the cancellation, then you might have been due compensation under EU261, but it's very likely that the airline would consider an epidemic to be ""extraordinary circumstances"" which removes the need for the airline to provide compensation.

Addition to address the update to the question :
Simplistically speaking, airline bookings have two parts - a ""reservation"" which covers the booking on specific flight segments on specific days, and a ""ticket"" which basically shows that you have paid for those flights.  When you book a flight, first a reservation is created, then you pay, and then a ticket is issued.

When you cancel flights, the reservation of those flights is cancelled.  At that point, you are no longer booked on those flights, although you still potentially hold a ticket.  This will happen immediately that you ask for the flights to be cancelled, as the airline wants to be able to free up the seats so they can sell them to someone else.  No refund will be made as a part of cancelling a reservation.

At this point, you hold a ticket that states you've paid $X for, but which contains no flight segments as they have been cancelled.  Depending on the airline, the actual ticket you purchased, and any special conditions the airline might allow (such as allowing refunds during an event like an epidemic even if the ticket doesn't normally allow refunds), the value on that ticket might be lost entirely, might be only able to be used to book a future flight, or might allow a refund.

In order to actually get the refund, whoever issued the ticket (which might be the airline you were flying, another airline, or a travel agency) will need to cancel it and process the refund back to you.  This is a separate step in the process, and it could happen hours, days, or even months after the reservation was cancelled.

However none of that changes the fact that once the reservation has been updated, you were no longer booked on that flight, and thus no longer due compensation.
",Accepted,"For a schedule change in advance it is always the ticketing carrier (in this case, Emirates) that is responsible for rebooking you after the change.

In a perfect world this would be handled automatically, but when multiple airlines are involved it generally doesn't - especially when those airlines are not part of the same alliance (Emirates is NOT OneWorld, despite your questions heading).  I would suggest reaching out to whoever you purchased your ticket from (either Emirates or the travel agent) and asking them to arrange an alternative. It is possible they will contact you, but the earlier you arrange the alternative the better the options may be.

Depending on how much notice you were given of this change and how much you need to change your arrival time, you may be able to claim compensation under EU261.

153901,Travelling by plane with a stop in China - will I be quarantined?,"I am going to Japan from Western Europe in March (by plane). I have a stop in Shanghai (~2h. long so I'll stay in airport). Due to the Coronavirus related protective measures, will I be quarantined when arriving to Japan?

UPDATE - 02-03-2020

I was able to reschedule my flights for later with no charge, so I chose another company and have direct flights now.
",153902,"No, you will not. Japan has banned entry of all foreigners who have travelled to Zhejiang and Hubei provinces within 14 days of travelling to Japan, but Shanghai, a provincial-level city, does not belong to either. You are (so far) safe.

It is, nevertheless, highly possible that Japan will soon extend this travel ban to the entirety of China. Keep updated. As a comment suggests, you are encouraged to keep an eye on the Timatic news feed, as well as the news.

Note: Take care of where is your next destination (transit or otherwise). For example, if it is Singapore and its within 14 days, Singapore will deny you transit or entry for the 2 hour you spent in China.

154022,Going to Mexico and back to the US with a Chinese citizen,"I am American and my girlfriend is a Chinese citizen who lives in the US. However, we were both in China in December and January (leaving on January 2nd, 2020) in areas that were unaffected by COVID-19 at the time.

We have a trip booked to Mexico City for spring break, so should we anticipate any issues with both traveling to Mexico and returning to the US? I assume I'll be fine, but should we prepare proof that my GF will have been in the US for 2.5 months before going to Mexico (and returning)?

They are a US citizen (with Global Entry, Known traveler etc.) who traveled to China in early January (and returned to the US then).  When returning recently from another trip (to a different country) they were flagged and questioned by CDC about the trip to China in Jan, even though this trip was unrelated.  They were told to expect to be questioned every time they re-enter the US now until the virus threat dies down.
From their description it sounds like they were sent by CBP immigration officer to meet with someone from CDC, and then were sent back through to immigration (a matter of minutes to maybe an hour, although they don't specify) - they were able to easily proceed to connecting flights without issue.

So I would say that Yes you should both prepare to be questioned over your travel to China when re-entering the US.  Nothing to do with being Chinese citizen, more to do with the questions for anyone who has been to China recently.

They will take the report and advise on the local procedures, arranging for her to come to the consular section for a new visa.

",Accepted,"As long as you travel within the EU (which for now still includes the UK), customs are not involved, the only thing they may check (and that's very very rare) are things that are actually illegal (drugs...) or where there are significant tax differences (cigarettes for instance). They will definitely not care about a laptop, accessories, or a graphics card.

If you enter or exit the EU (or travel between non-EU countries), in theory, they could force you to pay tax and duty on everything you carry beyond your personal allowance (usually around a few hundred euros), and you could then reclaim those when exiting again. In theory, you should use an ATA Carnet to avoid paying tax and duty.

In practice, in most countries (there are exceptions), they really don't care about all the stuff they know you'll bring back home when you leave. What is an issue to them is anything that will remain in the country. If your laptop, accessories, graphics card and whatnot look like you actually use them, they probably won't bat an eyelid. It would be different if you had a brand new laptop still in original shrinkwrapped packaging.

I think you confused security checks and customs in your question, but if it was indeed customs and not security that asked you to turn your laptop on, it was more probably to check that it was actually used (i.e. not waking up to the initial setup screens, but with an account created, applications installed, files present...).

As long as you can show them what you use the card for, I don't quite anticipate an issue.

If you really want to be on the safe side, get an ATA Carnet. But that's a bit cumbersome as it needs to have details of each trip, you often need to show the hardware to customs in your own country before and/or after leaving, you need lots of stamps, it's only valid for specific types of activities, etc. This is usually done only for hardware with prices in the thousands and more.

I will take my medication with me etc. I also look quite well.

I have a worry though. Can airport metal detectors/x-rays in the UK or in any airport detect temperature? If so and they want to pull me over for a check I will allow more time for airport security. 

Also, do you think they might have to test/quarantine me for coronavirus as the symptoms according to the NHS are:


  
  a cough
  a high temperature
  shortness of breath
  


I have a medium temperature and a mild cough (2 of 3 symptoms). It would be a pain and really upsetting to ruin my holiday.
",154045,"Neither the metal detectors, nor the full body scanners currently in use at UK airports are designed to measure or detect body temperature.

On a far simpler level the same kind of non-contact technology is also being used  in handheld thermometers.

At the moment this is primarily targeted at travellers from the highest-risk areas (i.e. mainland China). Since known cases in the UK are still extremely rare, it's likely you would be recognised as having a high probability of having some other virus (they are rather common after all).

",Accepted,"Old City Hall Station was the very first station on the once on the original New York Subway System. It was built under City Hall. Due to age and other factors, including the proximity to the newer Brooklyn Bridge station, it was put out of commission in 1945. It is now open to the public to see, but only on guided tours provided by the New York Transit Museum. The tours take about two hours, and start at the new Brooklyn Bridge station, which is approximately 600 feet away.

That paragraph is from the New York Transit Museum website. The first sentence refers only to the tour of the Old City Hall Station, and the other also includes things happening in and around the museum itself.

In order to take the tour of Old City Hall Station, you must be a member of the New York Transit Museum. Note that the tour costs $50 in addition to the membership fee. 

There are some strict rules you must follow, including:


  To be admitted to these restricted sites, participants must provide a copy of a government-issued ID for a background check, and must sign a release immediately after purchasing tickets. If you do not submit your signed release form and copy of a government-issued photo ID by the stated deadline you will not be permitted on the tour and you will not receive a refund.


The tours are sold out as soon as the tickets go on sale, usually within the first hour!

You usually need to wait until a designated time in order to get your tickets, which are released in blocks. Members receive an email newsletter three times a year, announcing the release of tickets for the coming few months. May through August tours become available in April. This means you may still be able to book a July tour if you check the website as soon as they go on sale! Tickets are sometimes made available during other times, but it's hard to know when those will be.

  Avoid contact with sick people.
  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
  Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.
  
  
  It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.
  Supplies of hand sanitizer, tissues, and other hygiene products may be limited, so consider bringing them with you.
  
  Pay attention to your health during travel and for 14 days after you leave.

",154433,"United Airlines uses a ""New Money"" concept for change fees.

Basically this means that you can cancel your flight at this time and receive a $953 credit voucher.  However in order to use that voucher at a later stage you will need to pay $400 ""new money"" (ie, the $400 can't come out of the voucher value), and then you'll be able to use the full $953 value of the credit.

Depending on when the trip is, you may want to wait until it's a little closer to the date to see if they add Rome to their waiver list for areas affected by the Coronavirus. If they do that you will likely be able to (at least) avoid paying the change fee.  The refund amount/change fee won't change over time, so as long as you cancel at least a day or two before the flight there's no reason not to wait.

It is worth to notice that this restriction affects also non-chinese residents of China, who are now also not able to apply for a visa.

Some media have indeed reported that the visa ban applies to all Chinese citizens, but there is no official information supporting that and I believe these reports to be mistakes. It seems very well possible for Chinese citizens who are resident outside China to get a Czech visa from the consulates at their place of residence and there seem to be no ban for residents of China to enter the Czech Republic if they are already in posession of a visa.

Unless the Czech Republic is the main destination in the Schengen area, it should also still be possible for Chinese residents to obtain a Schengen visa from other consulates and then use that visa for travel to the Czech Republic. It will probably have little impact on actual travel patterns for a single Schengen country to impose restrictions as have been done here.

Make an itemized list of everything that will be remaining in the US, along with its value.  Bring that with you when you travel, and present it with your customs declaration at the passport control desk.  Don't use an automated passport control kiosk if you can avoid it.

The way it's supposed to work is that you tell them about everything that's remaining in the US, and they tell you whether you have to pay duty.

It shouldn't be necessary.  It's seriously unlikely that a customs officer would challenge your ownership of the dress.  But it's possible, of course, and evidence of your marriage can't hurt.  A copy of your marriage certificate would surely be sufficient.

",154653,"I think the myth here is that an older aircraft isn't safer because of wear and tear. That's not really true due to maintenance requirements. If you want to, you could fly in a Douglas DC-3 (1930s aircraft) today if you had enough time and money to find the operator. Any aircraft can be operated if it is still maintained.

The reason aircraft get retired from commercial airlines is generally they become expensive to maintain, not because they stopped being airworthy. Airlines don't buy one airplane, they buy a fleet, which includes the maintenance portion. The larger picture there is you need


Trained pilots
Mechanics to repair them
Available parts


It's #3 that will eventually drive an aircraft out of general use. Delta, which flies the MD-80/88/90 series, is set to retire the aircraft in 2022.


  Delta will remove the MD-90 two-years earlier than previous plans to “realize fleet simplification benefits,” said Jacobson during the airline’s second quarter earnings call on July 11. The airline will replace the aircraft with ones from its current orderbook, which includes 77 Airbus A220s(sic, likely A320) and 144 Airbus A321s and A321neos, he added.
  
  The early retirement of some MD-90s was understood to be to support the in-service fleet, with parts from the removed aircraft available to support operational aircraft.


In other words, Delta cannibalized some of its fleet for parts, and may be actively doing so with its rolling retirement. McDonnell-Douglass (who made the planes) is now owned by Boeing, and production of the MD-90 ceased in 2000. These planes can still be flown after Delta retires them, but Delta will have a hard time (i.e. expensive) sourcing new parts, which makes less sense for an active carrier airline operating thousands of aircraft around the world. Other aircraft of similar size are in production and their parts are more plentiful.

The planes will be sold to secondary carriers. You might have seen one in the news recently, when the US government chartered a flight with Kalitta Air (likely operating a 747-400) to evacuate US citizens exposed to the coronavirus. These companies operate smaller fleets and, since they get cheaper used aircraft, the increased cost of finding parts will be offset.

TL;DR

The Boeing 777 is still in production. It is as safe as any aircraft in commercial airline use, regardless of age.
",Accepted,"Yes good maintenance practices and regular overhauls by the aircrafts operator reduce the chances of an accident but in my opinion the chances of a component failure do to metal fatigue increases with the age of the aircraft, This is because every time an aircraft is pressurised, lands and takes off significant forces act on all the structural components. Unless the aircraft is completely dismantled, NDT'd (non distructive testing) some small stress fractures can go undescovered.
Also newer aircraft have better, stronger and more resilient materials of manufacture.
Therefore you are more likely to have an incident on an older aircraft compared to a newer aircraft.

",154694,"In February, I flew into Singapore through Seoul, and back the same way to Toronto. Singapore had a jump in cases just as we arrived; Seoul's jump was happening while we were in Singapore. Here is what we did:


hand washing pretty much every chance we got. (I say pretty much because if you walk a long way in an airport you will walk past multiple bathrooms; we didn't go in to each and every one and have a wash.) But we did sometimes go and wash even though we didn't need to use the bathroom. For example, every time we returned to our hotel room after being out.
hand sanitizer after handling money, before eating, or when sitting waiting
use sanitizing wipes to clean the airplane screen and trays immediately on getting to the seats. I should have done the seatbelt and arm rests too and will on my next trip.
try to pay by credit card, using contactless, and holding my own card instead of handing it to someone to tap for me, whenever possible. Avoid cash -- it really is filthy
don't touch handrails and other ""public"" surfaces unless you actually need them for support. Keep your hands to yourself as much as you can. In Singapore there was a lot of wiping going on, but in other places I have not seen that
really try to touch your face less. It's hard, you just need to watch videos of people telling you not to touch their face while people behind them touch their faces, and then moments later the speaker does too. It's hard. That's why all the handwashing and hand sanitizing is important
if you cough or sneeze, use a tissue or your elbow to confine it, so as to cause less distress to those around you and lower overall stress - to do this, you'll need a loose tissue in your pocket that you can grab quickly. If there's no nearby garbage, you'll need another pocket you can designate for dirty tissues. When you see a garbage, empty the dirty pocket and sanitize your hands to lessen the chance you're passing anything along.
monitor your temperature. In Singapore this was done for me many times a day. On return home I checked my temperature twice a day or so for 14 days to be sure I was not running a fever.
tell the truth when you come home. Don't be that person who lies about where they have been. 


In addition, at least one friend has taken a laptop on vacation, not because she might need it during the vacation, but in case she was quarantined in her destination or on return before she could get to her home. 

There are enough cases in Ontario now that when I go to Toronto and ride the public transit, I'm going to take all these same precautions. This is really not just a travel issue any more.

However, there is something called ""satisfactory departure"" which can be granted to VWP visitors who cannot leave within their 90 days of admission due to an emergency like hospitalization or natural disaster in the US, to allow them to stay for an additional period of at most 30 days. I am not sure whether a fear of returning to a country with some disease transmission will qualify.

The US has also sometimes granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for years to people in the US who are nationals of developing countries that have suffered a major disaster with long-term effect on the country's infrastructure like a major earthquake, civil war, or Ebola outbreak, etc. However, I highly doubt that they would do that for COVID-19, as it is a short-term problem that does not significantly damage the country's infrastructure, and has mostly been in relatively developed countries. Also, Republicans have been wary of granting TPS.
",Accepted,"One hour and 15 minutes is tight but doable. You don't need to clear customs or Immigration and your bags will be checked through. However, you have to go through security once. ANA arrives Terminal and Air Canada departs Terminal 1. See https://www.narita-airport.jp/en/connect/inter/inter_inter_t1/ 

It's a legal connection, so if you don't make the flight, they will put you on the next one and put you up in a hotel if needed. 

In this case, it may be a good idea to check a bag. If you get snagged in security, the airline has the choice to wait or leave without you. However, they can't take your bag (for security reasons) without you being on board. So they would need to unload it first, which costs time and money. Hence they may be more inclined to just wait until you show up.

As stated in a comment by @DJClayworth, the US does not provide emergency care free of charge. Charges do vary between hospitals, and US healthcare is the most expensive in the world.

154675,Coronavirus cancels connecting flight,"My BF flies on Monday Athens-Zurich-Miami, with Swiss. He recently received an email saying that his flight details have changed, and he finds out that Lufthansa, ATH-ZRH operator, will most likely cancel the flight due to the COVID-19 coronavirus. The other flight is scheduled.

He went to the airport, but the booth told him that they assist only with today's flights, and gave him the central contact number. He calls, but fails getting through, most likely because of the heavy load of calls these days... He'll email them too, but with weekend ahead, it'll probably go without an on time response.

Any ideas on what'd be his next realistic steps? He's really stressed!
",154695,"He shouldn't get stressed too much. Lufthansa/Swiss are rearranging their schedule a bit, due to decreased demand. And yes, this will mean that some flights are cancelled. That does not mean that all flights are cancelled or that they won't take him at all. 

He has a ticket with Swiss, and they have to transport him to his destination, even if on a different flight. He does not have to worry about being ""left behind"" if he doesn't make his first flight.

Is the flight cancelled?

Currently, he does not know. He can (and should) check the flight status online (Swiss timetable and Lufthansa Flight Status).

As long as the flight isn't officially cancelled, it makes little sense to call or go to the airport - they can't tell you much. Also, it makes little sense to re-book if you don't know which flights are going to operate.

What happens if it is cancelled?

If the flight is cancelled, the airline will offer to re-book him on a different one: There are multiple flights from Athens to Zurich, but they could rebook him completely (e.g. going through Frankfurt on Lufthansa). If isn't happy with the new itinerary, they will usually offer other options. He could also get a refund, but it seems like he wants to travel.

If he booked it through a third party (e.g. Expedia), he'll have to go through them for any re-booking.

If the flight isn't cancelled, he should be at the airport early so that he can directly talk to the agents in case of a last-minute cancellation.

Other things

On their information page Swiss currently informs passengers that they can freely re-book all tickets bought before March 5th. (However, it seems like your BF wants to travel).

In case of a delay or cancellation your BF may also have a right to compensation under the EU rules - at least in this case, when the outbreak directly the reason for the cancellation.

154759,Airfare refunds for coronavirus,"Has anyone had success getting airlines to issue refunds, or at least extend the value of unused tickets, for upcoming travel that had been booked long before the COVID-19 outbreak?  

My question specifically concerns United Airlines and non-refundable tickets to destinations that are not otherwise covered by any explicit guidance.  I'd be interested in hearing about others though.

It seems like airlines are offering flexibility for new travel bookings but not ones made a while back.  And travel insurance will only cover you if your travel is individually impacted due to illness or quarantine.  
",154768,"Your question is very generic, so I answer in general:

In general if a government (or an airline) doesn't stop travellers or planes, you will have no direct refund. It means that both think that there is no danger.

So usually it is recommended to have a travel insurance (for important/expensive travel, like far away for holidays). On the other hand, also a travel insurance may not allow you to cancel: it depends on the kind of insurance you get: some (the more expensive) doesn't ask reasons, other are more restrictive (and again, if you are not in a risk category, and there is no recommendation from government) they will not refund you.

On the other hand, this is a special (and global) thing, so to get good news coverage, they may end to refund you. Cruise lines are starting this (also for old bookings), let's hope also the airlines will follow.

The reason about having such rules for new booking: they are trying to convince new people to book. Without such incentives, many passengers will not book (and after booking many will travel anyway), this will keep cashflow. Old booking: they have already paid, so if they do something, it is just to get good publicity.

Because the airlines will reduce flights, you may hope that they will effect your flight, so that you can cancel/rebook (or having credit for next flight).

  In order to implement the requirements of Civil Aviation Administration of China and continue with the joint prevention and control of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, Air China has made the following adjustments to the free refund rules to help passengers better plan their trips:
  
  I. Applicable Tickets
  
  All tickets with a ticket number beginning with ""999"" (including mileage award tickets) purchased before 0:00 AM on January 28, 2020 for Air China operated flights or CA-coded codeshare flights that have a travel date later than January 1, 2020 (inclusive).
  
  II. Ticket Handling Rules
  
  
  The tickets are valid for one year from the date of issuance. Any applicable tickets as defined above can be refunded free of charge within the validity period of one year as long as the refund is requested before the departure of the flight. We kindly ask the passengers to apply for refunds outside of peak periods.
  Passengers can apply for refunds through the original channels where they purchased the tickets. Tickets purchased through the Air China website, app or WeChat applet can be directly refunded in the original order.
  Air China will keep a close watch on the epidemic updates and make timely adjustments to the flights. To make better use of the transport capacity during the Spring Festival, we kindly ask the passengers to apply for refunds before the departure of the flight. If you have decided to cancel your trip, please cancel your check-in seat as soon as possible through the original check-in channels to avoid wasting the resources and to ensure the seat availability to other passengers who still need to travel.
  The rules are effective immediately and supersede the previous Notes on Free Refund for Air China Flight Tickets.
  
  
  The passengers' safety has always been Air China's top priority and we will respond quickly to the requirements of the authorities and provide services and support to the passengers on the shortest notice. Thank you for your understanding and support!

According to the link to the embassy you provided you will be denied entry to Jamaica. This will most likely already be executed by KLM staff in Frankfurt. This means you will be denied boarding in the first place.

The only exception would be if you are (also) a Jamaican citizen.
You did not mention when you are flying, so if your flight is only going to be in a few weeks or even days, the situation might have changed completely. Then you just have to wait and go an a day-by-day basis and see what the embassy has to say.

As per your suggestion that you could still only travel to Atlanta, I suggest you search for ""skipping one leg of a journey"" here on this site. This usually always turns out bad (especially for a possible return flight which will be cancelled by the airline). Since in the US you always have to check your bags again on an international transfer, you could get your bags at least and given the right Esta/Visa for the US you could leave the airport and wait two weeks there. Two weeks would be the minimum period you'd have to wait before being allowed entry into Jamaica. You would then have to buy a new ticket to Jamaica, of course and your return flight would have been cancelled and you would have to buy that one again, too.

Having a reservation relatively soon after the 16th is a positive point for you. Somebody who would be casually traveling from island to island less so.

Only a few airlines fly into Holguin, the only realistic alternative would be Condor via Frankfurt, then Lufthansa to UK.

To date I don’t recall seeing many questions about Air Canada and flight cancellations. I am aware that they are offering a flexible change policy right now. 

My question is: 


has anyone else been in this situation with Air Canada since the COVID-19 emergency erupted? Given that her cancelled flight was more than 48 hours away, can we expect Air Canada to email her again in the next couple of days with information about an alternative flight? Any advice (apart from the obvious around continuing efforts to contact the airline)?

",Accepted,"Your situation seems to be well in hand... but for others, another option is to contact your own embassy.  

As far as the embassy is concerned, this is called ""repatriation"": returning citizens to homeland.  At extremes, they'll send government aircraft*. But far more likely they'll just use their contacts within the airline** to get the flight you already paid for straightened out. 

In the event of a government-flown rescue like this, it is common for government X to give courtesy flights to government Y's citizens; so for instance the UK might have their citizens hitch a ride on a US State Dept. flight to Miami, rather than send a flight from the Cayman Islands and then on to (gosh, probably Miami). 





* For instance, America's State Dept. has the pull to get a military C-5 sent; some China evacuation was done by a Kalitta Air 747, under contract to the US military. However the State Dept. also has its own internal aircraft fleet also, including turboprops as large as Bombardier Dash-8's.

155009,UK Standard Visitor Visa implications during travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19 outbreak?,"My wife (a Kazakh national) is visiting in the UK on a Standard Visitor Visa, staying with my family. She arrived on Feb 1st. Her original intention was to stay for approximately 3 months, until April 30th, and stated as such on her application form. She had been to the UK twice already, and had always departed in line with her intentions as originally stated during her previous applications. Her current visa expires in July.  

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Kazahkstan will institute a one-month travel ban from tonight, preventing flights into the country. I'm a little concerned about what should happen if the ban is extended beyond that. 

I understand that the Home Office generally frowns upon visitors who stay longer than their stated intentions, even if they do not overstay their visa lengths. But if the Kazakh travel ban prevents her from travelling back to her country until a date beyond April 30th, might this cause a problem in her future visa applications? Or is it a reasonable excuse, and provided she explains the extended duration of her previous stay during the future application, might it be okay? 

Edit: On that note, she applied for this UK visa from China (where we lived at the time). Obviously, returning to China at this point, while theoretically possible (though we'd have to apply for new Chinese visas; they expired in February, a fact that she readily disclosed in her application), is hardly desirable. This is a circumstance that we could hardly have predicted beforehand. Her Chinese visa was temporary and she acknowledged this fact during her application. Might the UK officials think ""well, you couldn't fly to Kazakhstan, sure, but why not go back to China? After all, you applied from there"" ? I must stress that she never stated during her application that she intended to go back to China; indeed our plan was always for her to fly to Kazakhstan around April 30th, the original envisaged date of departure. Am I overthinking this, and would the specific country that she'd go to after departing the UK be of no concern to them whatsoever? 
",155011,"Normally, the UK authorities take a dim view of significant changes because they consider that someone who applies for a short visit but then stays very much longer is probably working illegally.

Note, however, that if she finds that she needs to stay beyond her visa she must contact the authorities to make arrangements for a longer stay.

FWIW, the countries that have imposed travel bans (there's a list on the NY Times) have not applied them to their own citizens. Your wife is likely to be allowed to travel, but might find it impossible to do so because flights are not available.

Which of these will be your future home away from home? (pic by me)

From Chipata to Lusaka you're on the Great East Road, which is the main highway connecting Lusaka to all points east.  There is thus a steady stream of trucks, buses etc and the infrastructure to cater for them.  That said, this is the African bush and there are no towns of size along the way, so you're not going to find anything approaching Western standards, but if you're OK with nshima and grotty rooms with a fan if you're lucky, you'll survive.

155045,May I get a refund for a flight cancelled because of COVID-19?,"I had a flight ticket from Madrid (MAD, Spain) to Miami (MIA, US) to fly in March with AirEuropa. I got an email saying the flight was cancelled 13 days and 21 hours before the flight. Am I eligible to get a cash refund? Am I entitled to further compensation?

The flight was cancelled the day after Donald Trump forbade the entrance of non-residents to the US because of COVID-19.

The answer from an AirEuropa agent is no, I am not. They offer a voucher that has to be spent within 2020, which IMO is very limited.

As I understand the EU rules, I can choose to get a refund unless the carrier can prove the cancellation was because of extraordinary circumstances. I guess COVID-19 is extraordinary, but Trump did not forbid flights to the US, but the entrance of some people, so AirEuropa could have flown that day.

Their homepage does only offer vouchers, though. The reason is likely that they want to hold on to the cash - espececially since they are not selling any new tickets right now.

Scenario one is that they do it because they aren't customer-friendly and they assume that only a fraction of the passengers will fight for their money. Scenario two is that they don't have the money to refund everyone and don't want to go bust.

My guess is that they are likely to fight any claim for monetary refunds. Basically your options are to take the voucher (hoping they will still be around when you want to use it), or to fight for a refund.

155132,Flight cancelled - forced to extend time abroad. Compensation?,"I booked an easyJet flight from London to Zurich several months ago. I also have an annual Coverwise travel insurance policy. I am a Swiss citizen but resident in the UK. 

I was scheduled to return back on the 23rd of March but easyJet has cancelled that flight. I am able to get a refund or change my flight date on easyJet but the next available date is not clear and looks like it will be after the 23rd.

Is there any compensation for the extra expenses of hotels (not yet booked) and subsistence for the extra days in Switzerland from either the airline or the travel insurance?
",155134,"I assume you have already travelled London - Zurich, and it is your return which has been cancelled, stranding you in Switzerland.

Whilst Switzerland is not in the EU, it is a signatory to EC261/2004. Thus cancellation of a departure from Zurich is covered by that regulation. 

Since these are extraordinary circumstances, you will be unlikely to receive the usual levels of compensation for a cancellation within 14 days of scheduled departure. 

However, this is distinct from the duty of care provisions. Provided you have not opted for refund on your cancelled flight, then guidance issued just yesterday confirms that this still applies, despite (or arguably, because of) a potentially lengthy stay: 


  According to Article 9 of the Regulation, which provides all relevant details, passengers
  who are affected by a flight cancellation must also be offered care by the operating air
  carrier, free of charge. This consists of meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to
  the waiting time; hotel accommodation if necessary, and transport to the place of
  accommodation. Moreover, airports are to provide assistance to disabled passengers and
  passengers with reduced mobility in accordance with Regulation 1107/20069
  .
  
  It is worth recalling that when the passenger opts for reimbursement of the full cost of the
  ticket, the right to care ends. The same happens when the passenger chooses re-routing at
  a later date at the passenger's convenience (Article 5(1)(b) in conjunction with Article
  8(1)(c)).
  
  The right to care subsists only as long as passengers have to wait for a rerouting at the
  earliest convenience (Article 5(1)(b) in conjunction with Article 8(1)(b)).
  
  The intention underlying the Regulation is that the needs of passengers waiting for their
  return flight or re-routing are adequately addressed. The extent of adequate care will have
  to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the needs of passengers in the
  circumstances and the principle of proportionality (i.e.: according to the waiting time).
  The price paid for the ticket or the length of the inconvenience suffered should not
  interfere with the right to care (Interpretative Guidelines Point 4.3.2).
  
  According to the Regulation, the air carrier is obliged to fulfil the obligation of care even
  when the cancellation of a flight is caused by extraordinary circumstances, that is to say
  circumstances that could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been
  taken.
  
  The Regulation contains nothing that recognises a separate category of 'particularly
  extraordinary' events, beyond the 'extraordinary circumstances' referred to in Article 5(3)
  of the Regulation. The air carrier is therefore not exempted from all of its obligations,
  including those under Article 9 of the Regulation, even during a long period. Passengers
  are especially vulnerable in such circumstances and events.10 In exceptional events, the
  intention of the Regulation is to ensure that adequate care is provided in particular to
  passengers waiting for re-routing under Article 8(1)(b) of the Regulation.

",Accepted,"I recall seeing Gayot Fow claim that this was possible, which one does not contradict lightly. On the other hand the ""conventional wisdom"" is that a Schengen consulate would probably refuse to examine a visa application from an Annex II national. And the Schengen rules I can find do not clearly seem to contemplate that possibility.

The rules context is quite different. A third-country national wishing to enter the UK needs to have either an ""entry clearance"" (applied for in advance) or ""leave to enter"" (granted by the immigration officer at the border). So having an entry clearance does, in principle, mean that you don't need to convince the IO to take the positive step of issuing a leave-to-enter, just that he should honor the entry clearance you already have.

In contrast the Schengen Borders Code states that all third-country nationals go through the same ""thorough check"", described in Article 8, subsection 3(a). Verification of a visa for Annex I nationals is in addition to that common procedure. At least as far as the EU legislation goes.

Neither does the Schengen Handbook for the processing of visa applications mention anything (in either direction) about visas for Annex II nationals.

This does not conclusively prove that there can't be an administrative practice of issuing visas to Annex II nationals who bother (and pay) to apply for one. But such a practice could well vary between member states. In particular, if you succeed in applying for a visa from one member state, and then enter the Schengen area through another member state, it might be that the border guards there would be confused rather than reassured if you present a visa.

Those terms are introduced later, during the check-in procedure, as part of ""cruise contract"". However at this moment the cruise has been already paid, and you're not having an option to decline the contract and get the full refund. Thus what Carnival is essentially doing is coercing you into contract modification, adding new terms which were not disclosed during the purchase. And the terms itself are not very clear.

The parts I think will be of most interest to the most people are those concerning cancellations by the airline, cancellations by the passengers themselves and compensation for delays and cancellations.

Flight Cancellations by Airline

In the case of a flight cancellation by the airlines (no matter what the cause is), Article 5
obliges the operating air carrier to offer the passengers the choice among:

a) reimbursement (refund);

b) re-routing at the earliest opportunity, or

c) re-routing at a later date at the passenger's convenience.

The guidance also makes very clear that if an airline offers a voucher instead of the choice between refund or re-routing, this does not affect the passenger's right to opt for a refund.

Flight Cancellation by Passenger

In cases where a passenger cannot or no longer wants to travel, whether or not the passenger is refunded or re-routed depends on the ticket type as specified by the airline's terms and conditions.

Right to 261/2004 Compensation

In short...a passenger is not entitled to EU261 compensation  for to delays or cancellations related to the pandemic. The airline still has a duty of care to their passengers who are travelling, which you can read more about.

Due to the coronavirus, travel restrictions have been imposed in our home country (India). Also we want to avoid the risk of traveling in flights at this time.

Is there an easy way to to extend her stay in the US by one or two months?

I am aware that we should fill out an I-539 to extend our stay. But in-order to submit the online application it requires a fee of $370. 


Is filing I-539 the easiest way to extend her stay at this time?
If so, is it possible to waive the fee due to the coronavirus
situation? 
After filing I-539 should she wait for an approval to continue her
stay? Or is the receipt good enough?


Can you please help me with these? Thanks!

[Edit 1]: 
With the current situation of the virus, traveling anywhere sounds like a very risky operation, especially for elders. 

That is the main reason behind this question. If the US government will allow visitors to overstay until Covid-19 settles down!
",155219,"
  Is filing I-539 the easiest way to extend her stay at this time?


Yes.  It's also the hardest way.  It's the only way.

More seriously, there could be some sort of amnesty or other program offered to nonimmigrants in the US who are affected by the pandemic.  If that happens, it could save you a few hundred dollars.

But I wouldn't count on it.  I certainly haven't heard any mention of it, and the current administration is profoundly anti-immigrant, so it's unlikely to happen without political pressure.

In terms of risk analysis, the application fee will be well spent.


  If so, is it possible to waive the fee due to the Corona virus situation?


Applying for a fee waiver is going to make her look like someone with financial problems, which will have a negative impact on her application as well as future applications for admission to the US.  I would not do it.


  After filing I-539 should she wait for an approval to continue her stay? Or is the receipt good enough?


Once the application is filed, she can remain until it is refused, or, if it is granted, until the end of the period of extended stay that is granted.

    coach will definitely or almost certainly be stopped in Switzerland for checks on luggage and things, can I risk being seized all my money by Swiss authorities or will I have to give them something?
    ...
    I've been told that Swiss authorities are quite ruthless.
    ...
    but even if they are scrupulous about this thing and ignore this rule because of their meticoulousness in everything, that is the least of my concerns. The problem is that if they check all my luggage and find a locked box with my savings, they could make up any excuse to take my savings away, and in that case I cannot appeal, get justice or nothing.
    ...
    No, I wasn't meaning that I want to bribe them, I was meaning whether they will ASK me a percentage of my money. 
  


No, you need not fear that Swiss Customs will seize all your money


you don't even have to declare it 


Switzerland Customs: Cash, foreign currencies, securities 


  Unrestricted amounts of liquid funds, i.e. cash, foreign currency and securities (shares, bonds and cheques) can be imported into Switzerland, brought through Switzerland in transit or exported from Switzerland. Furthermore, the funds do not need to be declared.




When traveling crossing over any European Union country border, on the other hand, you 


may be required to declare any money amount >= € 10.000 


Rules for carrying alcohol, tobacco, cash in the EU and leaving and entering the EU 


Switzerland is not an European Union country 


so must be declared when leaving Italy and entering Germany or France




  Carrying cash
  If you plan to enter or leave the EU with EUR 10 000 euros or more in cash (or the equivalent in other currencies) you must declare it to the customs authorities. Failure to do so could result in your cash being retained by the customs authorities, and you may receive a fine. Be aware that the customs authorities may carry out individual checks as well as checks on your baggage and/or vehicle.
  
  If you want to travel between EU countries (in this case, the 28 EU member states) with EUR 10 000 euros or more in cash (or the equivalent in other currencies), you must check with the customs authorities in the countries you are leaving, entering and passing through whether you must declare it.




This means that you will have to properly inform yourself about each Customs authority in (depending on your route between Italy and Belgium) 


Italy, Germany, France and Belgium 


based on the IATA information seem to be the same for the 4 countries 




  Currency Import regulations:
  Same regulations as for Export apply.
  
  Currency Export regulations:
  Local currency (Euro - EUR) and foreign currencies: no restrictions if arriving from or traveling to another EU Member State.   
  
  If arriving directly from or traveling to a country outside the EU: amounts exceeding EUR 10,000.- or more or the equivalent in another currency (incl. banker's draft and cheques of any kind) must be declared.


if you must report and possibly show the transported money upon


entry and exit to Switzerland from Italy and France/Germany 


and what may happen if you fail to do so. 

Be rest assured that the experiencing of Customs Officials (of any country) becoming quite ruthless will be the least of your problems if you are caught smuggling undeclared funds. 

Unfortunately the IATA data is not correct as Customs pages of the individual countries show:

Travelling within the European Union (EU)


check referenced sourses below for any changes


Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finnland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Sweden does not require or does not meantion any declaration requirements when entering entering or exiting a European Union country. 

United Kingdom (pre-Brexit conditions only) when travelling from another EU country 


no declaration is needed



  
    If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you’ll need to declare cash of £10,000 or more (or the equivalent in another currency) up to 72 hours before arriving in the UK.
  


Belgium, Germany and Lithuania require you, when travelling from another EU country 


to declare sums >= € 10.000 when asked


Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Italy, Malta, Poland and Spain requires you to always 


declare sums >= € 10.000 on entry and exit


Pdf form for France in French 
Pdf form for Italy (parent page Trasferimento di denaro contante, in case link breaks)



In the Italian version there is this friendly reminder of the possible sanctions, to encourage travelers to fill the form correctly.  


  Sanctions
  
  In case of failure to produce the declaration or in case of incorrect or incomplete information, the person submitting the same declaration is punished with a sanction amounting to a minumum of €300 up to a maximum of 40% of the value of the transfer exceeding €10.000 (article 3 of Regulation 1889/2005/EC and article 9 of Legislative Decree n.195/2008) and the cash be subject to seizure (article 6 of Legislative Decree n.195/2008). Failure to indicate personal data of the person on whose behalf the transfer is made or the reporting of false data shall be punished - except where the act constitutes a more serious offence, by imprisonment from 6 months to a year and by a fine ranging from € 516,46 to € 5.164,57 (art. 5, c. 8 bis, of Decree Law 167/1990, transformed in Law 227/1990).


That law is probably what originated your misconceptions about Swiss Custom officers, while it is only an Italian matter. Also for small sums if you pay the fine on the spot you get a discount (to pay the higher amount between 200€ and 5% of the exceeding sum) and the remaining cash shall not be seized unless there are other issues.

I would advise making 2 copies of each and ask the Customs to confirm the second copy in case you don't receive some sort of confirmation directly.   

These confirmations should be retained since they may be helpful in the future to prove that you did everything correctly.

155236,Booking.com not refunding my Disneyland Paris stay,"Back in January, I booked to stay in Hotel Disneyland Santa Fe in March (in Paris). Due to the effect Covid-19 has had in everyday life and travel, Disneyland Paris had to close including the hotels for guests who were not there at the time of the closing down decision. I contacted Booking.com 5 days before my stay at the Hotel and explained the situation and they said they would get back to me in 24 hours. 

In the meantime, I contacted the hotel and they said that I should only deal with Booking.com as it's their booking to manage. The hotels in Disneyland Paris also announced that for the visitors affected they would offer either a full refund or a chance to reschedule for a later date whilst keeping the same charge for the rooms as the ones in their original booking. 

Now Booking.com says that since the reservation wasn't cancelled beforehand and they're unable to cancel it after the arrival date has passed, they can only offer me half of the money back. I should note that on my initial phone call with them I wasn't told to cancel the booking or do anything for that matter, as they would have to investigate the best way to resolve this. 

The booking was made using my credit card, but since it was made in January, I'm now out of the period that I can ask them to step in and withdraw the money and return them back to my account. 

Is there anything that I can do at this point to make sure I get my money back for a travel that I was not allowed to make considering the hotel was not accepting guests and the French government was cancelling my Eurostar trains at the same time (Eurostar, by the way, has issued a full refund since my trains got cancelled). Alternatively is there any official route to report this behaviour or complain about it?

I live in the UK if that's relevant at all.
",155238,"You might be out of the period when you can request a chargeback, but you can still contact your credit card provider and require them to honour their obligations under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act if the cost was more than £100, as there is no time limit on that.
",Accepted,"This is 100% to be a scam. Let's see why:


a viewing before completing the transaction through Booking.com would not be possible. &lt;= this is where you should run screaming and not read anything else. Even if the place exists, how would you know it's not a mold infested, badly insulated garbage heap?
If they wanted to do a  real long term rent through an app they would use airbnb which allows for this and not booking.com which doesn't. It is a huge red flag they want to use a platform not suited for long term. 
I will send you the booking invitation through the Booking.com system &lt;= once again, airbnb has this but even there only after enquiring after a property, Booking.com very simply does not have such a feature. This person is talking nonsense, we will see why.
Booking.com will automatically provide the tenancy agreement. &lt;= the very reason Booking.com stops at 30 days is because in a lot of jurisdictions 30 days is where a short term becomes a tenancy and booking.com does not want to mess with tenancy agreements. Booking.com most assuredly will not provide a tenancy agreement! I have first booked an apartment with Booking.com close to five years ago and there's nothing even remotely close to a tenancy agreement in all those emails, I reviewed a few again.
If you don't like the property for any reason, Booking will refund your money on the same day. &lt;= Booking.com doesn't exactly work like that. As this blog post shows, the host sets the cancellation policy and up until very very recently the scammer was able to siphon the funds off as soon as the reservation becomes 90% non-refundable, otherwise on the guest’s check-in date. See for example here. Right now, because of the COVID-19 situation, they can only get their money one day past check in per this update but I somewhat suspect they are not 100% up-to-date. Also, do you want to convince Booking.com that the apartment simply doesn't exist within less than 24 hour before your money is gone? If Booking.com doesn't side with you then your only avenue is to sue them in a Dutch court of law.


Finally, if I needed to make a grim bet, I would put my money on this being nothing more than bait-and-switch and they don't want to use Booking.com: you agree to this, and after some hemming and hawing and probably a few juicy photos they come back complaining about some problems with booking.com listing and ask for a plain vanilla WU wire. By this time you are hopefully hooked enough to go ahead with it, if not, what's there to lose for them? You can even test it by agreeing and see what happens, just don't send money to them... 

And if you are wondering how people rent long term in a different country: they might have boots on the ground (company or friend) and if they don't then just do a short term rent much like it'd be a vacation and get a place once you are there. Easy as pie. I did so when I landed in Vancouver.

155243,Air France cancellation policy seems to violate EU261,"Air France states that for COVID-19 related cancellations:


  ""... or complete the online form below to obtain a travel voucher. This voucher is valid for 1 year on all Air France, KLM, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic flights. This voucher will be refundable after one year if it is not used.""


Source

That seems like a ploy to circumvent EU261 regulations which I believe require a full refund in cases of cancellations. Air France is offering sort of a refund but with one year delay built in. 

Background: we have an US&lt;->India ticket booked on Expedia with an Air France ticket. We obviously can't fly this and some legs have already been cancelled anyway. We like a full refund, not airline credit.

Question: What's the best strategy to approach this? We shouldn't really call Expedia until 72-hours before departure, Air France says ""call your travel agent"" and I'm worried that Expedia will simply say ""airline is offering credit: take it or leave it. EU261 is not our problem"". Does anyone have some experience with Air France cancellations recently?
",155245,"I would say that at least Air France is being fairly up front in light of the (probable) fact that their cash flow does not suffice for the refunds that they are obliged to provide.  If they hadn't come up with this voucher policy and instead decided to acknowledge their obligations up front, they would probably nonetheless drag their feet a year or more before actually giving you the money.

That said, the regulation does in fact specify reimbursement within seven days.  So you could pursue them if you want to.  Short of hiring a lawyer, the regulation provides that you can seek enforcement through the national enforcement body designated under Article 16(1).  A list of such bodies is found on the website of the European Commission.
",Accepted,"Today I see only one way out of this situation - chargeback.
Because KLM / Air France is now refusing everyone to refund.
Notwithstanding the clarification of the European Commission, where it is said that they should to refund.

155244,What is Essential Travel?,"In response to the current pandemic, the government of Canada recently said to:


  Avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada


Other governments have made similar statements restricting travel.

So, if one is to avoid non-essential travel: What essential travel is allowed?

Below are some examples that came to mind but what are exactly determines if travel is in fact essential?

Things that come to mind:


Journalists going to where they want to investigate for a report.
Going to help isolated family members
Business meetings and factory visits, whether to establish policy or oversee measures that related to the COVID-19 or other task related to production.


Is any proper documentation needed to show that travel is essential? Or do we expect gate and border agents to evaluate on the spot based on your word?
",155258,"Some examples that I have seen in the media:


a healthcare worker who lives in Windsor, Canada and works in Detroit, USA. There are thousands of such people and they cross the border every day. They are doing so to deliver an essential service (healthcare) so their travel is essential
a truck driver pulling a load of food, medical supplies or other essential goods. While in theory the delivery company could have the truck handed off to a different driver at the border, more realistically the truck and driver will be allowed in as essential travel
a patient returning to their home city to keep an appointment for needed surgery. Most elective surgeries, dentist appointments and such are being cancelled, but a person could have been away just before their scheduled surgery
farm workers from Central America are going to be allowed in to Canada because our farms can't function without them


What is not essential?


tourism
business or work that does not serve an essential purpose (making a movie, looking for new restaurant locations to buy or rent in another city, negotiating a big purchase business-to-business of something non-essential like bathing suits or makeup)
people who feel they would be less likely to catch this if they went to their second home in the country
people who prefer the weather in Ontario to the weather in Alberta at this time of year


If I was going to do some essential travel I would bring whatever proof I could, and I would prepare for a significant wait while my explanation was evaluated. I am tempted to say, if you have to ask, it's not essential. I personally have cancelled a followup CAT scan and MRI scan required by a clinical study I am in. Everything's been stable for a while, so I'm not going to the big city. It doesn't feel essential to me. 

March 28th, the CBSA tweeted this image:



Keep in mind that in many Canadian provinces, non-essential workplaces are closed, so where this image says ""work"" it means ""essential work"".

Also, this applies only to people without symptoms. People with symptoms, whether citizens returning home, truck drivers pulling essential supplies, anyone will be refused or (more likely) taken into quarantine until they test negative. Also March 28th people with symptoms will be refused boarding on domestic flights and trains, regardless of the reason for travel.

155259,Who is responsible for the refund policy on a code-share flight?,"During July 2019, I booked flight UA7938 for March 30 through United Airlines for my honeymoon. With everything involving Covid-19 happening, I'm trying to see if I can get a refund for the ticket or an extension on the ticket. My main issue is that I do not know who is responsible for a potential refund. United is the marketing airline and ANA is the operating airline.

United is waiving change fees for flights booked prior to March, which I can apply to my ticket online, but I would have to travel before July 2020. I don't know what kind of travel I can do before July and I do not want my money to go to waste. On the other hand, ANA has been issuing refunds for all international flights booked prior to March. Do I follow United's policies or can I follow ANA's? Has anyone had luck with similar situations?
",155274,"When you buy an airline ticket there are up to 3 separate airlines that can be involved for each leg of the flight.  These are common known as :


The ""Marketing Carrier"".  This is the airline who's flight number is on the ticket/itinerary.
The ""Operating Carrier"".  This is the airline who's aircraft will actually fly the flight.
The ""Ticketing Carrier"".  This is the airline that actually sold you the ticket.


(The ticketing carrier will be the same for all legs of the flight on the same ticket. The other two can vary from leg-to-leg)

In many cases, all 3 will be the same - you buy a ticket from airline XX, for flight XX123, which is flown by airline XX themselves.

In your case, all 3 are not the same.  UA7938 is marketed as a United Airlines flight (thus the UA flight number), but the operating carrier is ANA.  What we can't tell from the information you've provided is who the Ticketing Carrier is - and that's the one that actually matters here!

If you purchased your ticket directly from an Airline website, then you can be fairly sure that's the ticketing carrier.  If you purchased it from a travel agency, then it's a little more complex.  In general, if all flights on a ticket are for the same marketing airline (eg, all UAxxx flight numbers) then most likely the ticket was issued by that airline.

To be certain, you'll need to check the ticket itself. In your email confirmation (or on the relevant website for where you bought the ticket) you should find a ""ticket number"" which is generally around 13 numbers long.  The first 3 digits in this number show who the Ticketing Carrier is.  If this number is 016, then your ticket was issued by United Airlines.  If it's 205, ANA.  If it's 014, it's Air Canada.

Now, back to your original question. The policies that apply in a situation like this will be the policy of the TICKETING carrier.  That carrier might be influenced by the OPERATING or MARKETING carriers policies, but officially it is the ticketing carrier that you've paid for your ticket, and it's them that has your money up until the time that you actually take the flight.

In your case it's most likely that United is the ticket carrier so it would be their policies that apply - but you'll need to check the ticket number to be sure!

  Hi ****,
  
  I am sure you are aware of the current virus pandemic spread
  worldwide; all doctors here in Switzerland are now the 1st line of
  defense in the race to control the spread of the virus. Since I'm
  working over 16 hours/day to help my colleagues to fight this pandemic
  and as well it's not recommended to get a flight these days, a viewing
  before completing the transaction through Booking.com would not be
  possible.
  
  Also a video tour of the property is available if you would like to
  check it out: URL 
      Allow me to explain the Booking.com process step by step.
  
  
  Upon your request, I will list the property online on Booking.com for GBP 1,100 / month with all the bills included.
  I will send you the booking invitation through the Booking.com system so you will have 24 hours to confirm it or the invitation will
  expire.
  Once you receive the booking invitation from Booking.com, you will have to choose your check-in date ( this would be the date that you
  would prefer to move in ) &amp; staying period ( minimum one month and
  maximum five years )
  After registration, you will have to pay £ 2,200 to Booking.com to get your reservation confirmed. The payment of £ 2,200 would be used
  as a 1 (one) month of rent + 1 (one) month security deposit. You can
  use it as the last month of rent or take it back at the end of your
  stay.
  Booking.com will automatically provide the tenancy agreement. Booking.com's policy allows maximum 1-month bookings, but choosing a
  more extended period will enable you to have the contract for it and

  Let me know when would be the best time for you to list the property

Is this a genuine method to rent properties in a different country through booking.com, or is it part of an elaborate scam?
",156364,"This is 100% to be a scam. Let's see why:


a viewing before completing the transaction through Booking.com would not be possible. &lt;= this is where you should run screaming and not read anything else. Even if the place exists, how would you know it's not a mold infested, badly insulated garbage heap?
If they wanted to do a  real long term rent through an app they would use airbnb which allows for this and not booking.com which doesn't. It is a huge red flag they want to use a platform not suited for long term. 
I will send you the booking invitation through the Booking.com system &lt;= once again, airbnb has this but even there only after enquiring after a property, Booking.com very simply does not have such a feature. This person is talking nonsense, we will see why.
Booking.com will automatically provide the tenancy agreement. &lt;= the very reason Booking.com stops at 30 days is because in a lot of jurisdictions 30 days is where a short term becomes a tenancy and booking.com does not want to mess with tenancy agreements. Booking.com most assuredly will not provide a tenancy agreement! I have first booked an apartment with Booking.com close to five years ago and there's nothing even remotely close to a tenancy agreement in all those emails, I reviewed a few again.
If you don't like the property for any reason, Booking will refund your money on the same day. &lt;= Booking.com doesn't exactly work like that. As this blog post shows, the host sets the cancellation policy and up until very very recently the scammer was able to siphon the funds off as soon as the reservation becomes 90% non-refundable, otherwise on the guest’s check-in date. See for example here. Right now, because of the COVID-19 situation, they can only get their money one day past check in per this update but I somewhat suspect they are not 100% up-to-date. Also, do you want to convince Booking.com that the apartment simply doesn't exist within less than 24 hour before your money is gone? If Booking.com doesn't side with you then your only avenue is to sue them in a Dutch court of law.


Finally, if I needed to make a grim bet, I would put my money on this being nothing more than bait-and-switch and they don't want to use Booking.com: you agree to this, and after some hemming and hawing and probably a few juicy photos they come back complaining about some problems with booking.com listing and ask for a plain vanilla WU wire. By this time you are hopefully hooked enough to go ahead with it, if not, what's there to lose for them? You can even test it by agreeing and see what happens, just don't send money to them... 

And if you are wondering how people rent long term in a different country: they might have boots on the ground (company or friend) and if they don't then just do a short term rent much like it'd be a vacation and get a place once you are there. Easy as pie. I did so when I landed in Vancouver.

156465,Are there alternatives for booking flights unavailable directly via the airline (but available from an Online Travel Agent?),"This year I had something happen to me twice, which I never witnessed before nor I thought possible: An airline has flights for the legs that I'd like to fly on, but if I try to book the whole trip, it only proposes me a more complex trip with an extra leg. In the meanwhile, the desired booking is possible on an OTA website.

I presume that this might be because OTAs have access to more inventory, but this seems weird. The two examples were:

London to Yekaterinburg: I flew with British Airways + S7. They are partner airlines and S7 can sell me the London-Moscow leg of the trip, but S7 was only offering me a more complex trip (something like: London - Berlin - Moscow - Yekaterinburg)

London to Longyearbyen: I booked a SAS trip with Layover in Oslo (cancelled due to Covid19), but the SAS website was only offering me trips like: London - Copenhagen - Oslo - Longyearbyen or London - Stockholm - Oslo -Longyearbyen 

In the above cases, I booked from an OTA, but I'd really prefer to avoid in the future (in one direction, my luggage couldn't be checked-in all the way through even if that went smoothly on the way back. I got multiple check-in codes for the same booking, and making changes is just overall much more painful if a travel agent is involved).

I just managed to find another example (again, for Longyearbyen: just an example, since I'm not currently planning of flying there in September):



As you can see, for the day only trips with 2 layover are offered.

But I checked on 4 different OTAs, and all of them are offering a booking with a single layover:


Expedia

Lucky2go





Lastminute





Gotogate




This seems even weirder, when you consider that the single legs are actually available for purchase on SAS itself:





But somehow, SAS doesn't allow me to purchase this trip directly with them.

How common is this? Are there other solutions besides booking via an OTA? Would I be able to maybe get the booking done by directly calling the airline? (and if so, would this be standard practice, or should I expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline?)
",156470,"This happens quite regularly for multi-carrier trips. Less so for single carrier trips.

Airline search algorithms are often inferior

For single carrier trips, it's almost always because the airline's search algorithm doesn't find the trip you want, not because the airline doesn't sell it.

If the search tool is an in-house product, it may be inferior in an absolute sense compared to something like ITA's QPX search, which many OTAs now use. Writing a search algorithm for airline flights is a terrifically hard problem (formally it is classed as ""undecidable""), and airlines don't hire the kind of computer scientists who can solve it efficiently. Specialists like ITA have hundreds of computer scientists.

Alternatively, an airline's search may be tuned with different preferences to an OTA. A lot of airlines try to avoid overnight stops, even if that would be preferable to three flights at a higher price. I would guess that's the cause of your SAS problem here.

Solutions


Try the multicity search, and put some of the connecting cities in as if they were stopovers. When you choose the dates, choose the dates that you'll actually fly that leg. This is often a good bet, but it sometimes causes the airline to price your trip with a fare break point at the stopover (i.e., as a sum of one way fares instead of a single through fare): Iberia.com is particularly terrible for this shortcut. However, I notice SAS has helpfully removed its multicity feature as part of the dumbing down exercise that makes the rest of its webpage unusable on a real computer.
Bookwithmatrix or Google Flights can sometimes link you directly to the desired itinerary on the airline's site. (If you do this on aa.com, you'll find that you get kicked out at the payment stage if your credit card's address isn't in the United States. But it turns out AA doesn't actually validate the country field, so you can just leave it set to United States.)
Call the airline, tell them what flight numbers you want to fly, and give them the price you expect. There is usually a telephone booking fee for doing this, although if you have some status with the airline it might be waived, particularly if you explain their website was not good enough to do it online. I used to have a friend at the Amsterdam ticketing desk for British Airways. In what I consider a crowning achievement some years ago, I constructed a price for a trip from information on expertflyer.com that was 50% lower than his system or any OTA admitted, and after some back and forth with revenue management, he agreed it was a bug in their pricing system and sold me the itinerary at the lower price. :-)



  (and if so, would this be standard practice, or should I expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline?)


BA, AA, KLM, 90% success rate, sometimes have to hang up and call again. Qantas, JAL, Cathay Pacific, their telephone staff and ticket desks are always reliable. Air France, maybe 50%. Iberia, Alitalia, LATAM: total waste of time. 

Point-of-sale differences in inventory

Sometimes, additional inventory is available in the city where the travel agent is based, compared to where the airline is calculating the price. To understand why that can be the case, you should know that ""how many seats left for sale on a plane"" is a function of the sales city as well as other factors. Airline websites, in my experience, usually price from the city of origin, whereas agents usually price from a fixed point. One way to see this is from the payment currency, which will invariably be the currency of the sales city. For instance expedia.fr prices out of Paris, regardless of whether the itinerary passes through that city.

This only seems to matter when the flight is filling up.

Ticket issuance restrictions in the fare

Sometimes, the airline really cannot sell you the trip. This may be because the trip comprises multiple fares and one of the fares has a restriction that it must be issued ""on the stock"" of a ticket airline. Stock here refers to the old fashioned 4-part carbon paper tickets, but the concept is directly implemented in electronic ticketing. For instance, looking at a cheap S7 fare from London to Yekaterinburg:

Category 15: Sales restrictions
  TICKETS MUST BE ISSUED ON S7.
         NOTE -
          SALES PERMITTED ON TICKET STOCK VALIDATED OR
          PLATED S7/421 ONLY.


Even though a BA plane will fly you the first leg from London to Moscow, BA could not sell you a journey involving this particular fare. Airlines always sell tickets on their own ""paper"", not as agents for another airline; in this case, BA sells tickets on BA plate (ticket number starting ""125-"") and S7 sells tickets on S7 plate (ticket number starting ""421-""). But a travel agent could pick any validating carrier with whom it has a ticketing agreement, subject to the fare rules and the agreement. So the travel agent has some additional flexibility. 

This really only matters when you have a particularly complicated trip with multiple airlines who don't partner together very closely.
",Accepted,"I had no trouble taking a quart ziploc bag of all my meds on the plane.  All were in their original bottles, however a few days worth were in a pill calendar.  It didn't come up, but if inspected, all the pills in the calendar would have matched pills in the bottles.  

If you don't want your fellow pax seeing what you are taking, then either use a pill calendar as I did, or take it into the bathroom.  For a single dose or day's worth, you could substitute 1-2  small ziplocs for the pill calendar.

Another option is, after security, sit at a table in a restaurant or seating at a gate no one is at, and go through your pill bottles and put your next dose in a small ziploc you brought along.  You could do the same in the airplane lavatory, but that is very rude if there's a line.

Why do some airlines and air travel agencies send confirmation emails even if the flight has been cancelled?



Examples:


LATAM: Flights from Peru were cancelled because of the state of emergency. However, one day before the flight, my flight was still appearing as SCHEDULED.

I called LATAM to ask if the flight is indeed scheduled and not cancelled. They told me that so far they do not have that specific flight marked as cancelled in their systems and they recommended to check the next day (the day of the flight). They mentioned a refund can't be done because the flight is not cancelled.

Obviously, during the night, SCHEDULED turned into CANCELLED.
Delta Airlines: Flight cancelled, but they send emails how to prepare for the flight and how to reach the airport and buy seats.
Kiwi.com and Opodo.com.uk: Flight cancelled, but they send notifications via email and push notifications to prepare for the flight and prepare my bags etc.




Apart from technical issues, is there any strategy in this scenario (e.g. marketing, whatever)?

I am a programmer and I can imagine that in the source code they can simply have an if condition checking if the flight was cancelled to not send any notifications anymore related to how to prepare for the flight.
",156502,"'I'm a programmer...'

International airline ticketing systems are huge, complex systems requiring interaction with the public, the staff, and other huge complex ticketing systems. Ensuring an accurate and timely flow of information through such a structure is no mean feat.

These systems were built for an environment where most flights departed on or fairly close to schedued time. In a matter of weeks the world has gone from that to an environment where most flights are now cancelled.

Your 'simple ""if""' may not be simple at all, but assuming the change was to be made, the process of approval, development, testing, staging and deployment could easily take weeks. There simply hasn't been time for such development to take place, even assuming that the developers consider that it's worthwhile.

I suggest that with the chaos currently reigning in the air travel industry, receiving an email with directions to the airport has been considered unimportant. 

Airlines have bigger fish to fry.
",Accepted,"In a free market like in the UK, prices are generally governed by demand and supply and customers Willingness To Pay (WTP). Pricing and Analytics is big business with advanced data crunching and thousands of variables.

It’s as simple as that. So far as consumers are willing to pay a certain price there is little motivation to reduce it.

If and when customers are unwilling to pay the price, the price will drop to the point where they are willing to pay for the goods or service. At that point if the price is such that the company’s costs are exceeding its income, the company either go bust or finds cost cutting measures and efficiencies or sometimes subsidized by government.

Bottom line the prices are high because customers still purchase. Although they both transport people, airlines and trains are not perfect competitors. Each has peculiarities that appeal to a segment of the consumer base at a particular price point.

To reduce the need for people to go to DMV offices during the coronavirus pandemic, the deadline of October 1, 2020 has been postponed until October 1, 2021.  Thanks to choster for linking to an initial report by Bloomberg News.

Several news organizations have been reporting the new deadline at least since yesterday evening.  An official press release from the acting Secretary of Homeland Security is dated yesterday, March 26 2020.

The page quoted below has now been updated, as have the quotes themselves.  I've also adjusted the answer to account for the fact that Pennsylvania is now compliant with Real ID rather than being on an extension.



Have a look at https://www.dhs.gov/real-id-public-faqs:


  Q: When will I need to change how I travel domestically?
  
  Beginning October 1, 2021 every state and territory resident will need to present a REAL ID compliant license/ID, or another acceptable form of identification, for accessing Federal facilities, entering nuclear power plants, and boarding commercial aircraft. The card, itself, must be REAL ID compliant unless the resident is using an alternative acceptable document such as a passport or passport card, or state-issued Enhanced Driver’s License. The Act does not require individuals to present identification where it is not currently required to access a Federal facility (such as to enter the public areas of the Smithsonian) nor does it prohibit an agency from accepting other forms of identity documents (such as a U.S. passport or passport card).


You can use a Pennsylvania-issued document (license or ID card), even if the document is not compliant, through September 30, 2021.  After that, you'd need a compliant document or one issued by the federal government (for example, a passport or passport card).

Is Pennsylvania compliant?  Does it have an extension?  See the main Real ID page at https://www.dhs.gov/real-id, which shows a map indicating that Pennsylvania is compliant.  You can choose Pennsylvania in the ""select a state"" box below the map to see the details:


  Pennsylvania is compliant with the REAL ID Act. Federal agencies can accept driver's licenses and identification cards from Pennsylvania at Federal facilities and nuclear power plants.


On or after October 1, 2021, you'll need a Real-ID-compliant driver's license or your passport (or another document from the TSA list, if you have one).

Unless things get positively apocalyptic, it is exceedingly unlikely that Japan's airports would shut down completely.  Flights might be reduced, but as a comparison point, airports in China -- even in Wuhan -- have kept operating throughout the crisis there.
On the inbound flight, this would require an infected person coming from Munich or London, which is statistically improbable.  On the way back, this is a higher possibility, but still unlikely unless (again) there's a major outbreak.


FWIW, I was in Tokyo last week, and while it's not exactly panic in the air, people are definitely taking precautions: temperature scans at the airport, more masks than usual, hand washing &amp; sanitizers, large gatherings cancelled, etc .  This in itself seems likely to limit the spread of the virus, making full-blown contagion less likely.  But at the end of the day it's your call.

many recent/upcoming flights have been cancelled
many recent/current flights are flying or have flown
many upcoming flights are still scheduled, but that can of course change at any time.

154347,What is going to happen to me in Doha or Vienna Airport given the Coronavirus situation?,"I live in Iran and I have bought this Qatar Airways flight from Tehran (Iran) to Vienna for February 29. As far as I know, to this moment the flight is not cancelled for health concerns regarding Coronavirus. Although I don't know of any way to make sure about that. So I might have to go to airport and see what is going on. 

And I don't want to cancel the flight, since I should be there in Vienna for my job starting March 1.

But, in case the flight is not cancelled by the airline, I don't know what is going to happen to me at the airports. Some people say that they might put me in quarantine at Qatar airport or at Vienna airport, maybe for 14 days. 

Has anyone have any view or experience regarding such conditions? I am kind of panicked and overwhelmed by thoughts and concerns.  
",154371,"The first thing you should do is contact your new employer. They may have procedures in place for any people coming for affected zones (China, Northern Italy, Iran...) to be isolated from other staff and/or the public.

It is difficult to guess what measures will be taken by the various authorities in Iran, Qatar and Austria regarding quarantine and isolation, or even outright travel bans, as this can change by the hour.

Qatar Airways have already cancelled 2 out of 3 of the flights from Tehran to Doha these last few days, and in the upcoming days.

Even if there are no bans or quarantines, and even taking into account switching to a larger plane and cancellations/rebookings, squeezing passengers booked on 3 different flights on a single probably means severe overbooking. Be prepared to be bumped off the flight if there are Qatari citizens or residents and/or premium passengers that need a seat on that plane.

The remaining flight on Saturday has been rescheduled to over an hour earlier. Add to that there will probably be lots of additional checks before boarding, and the fact that there will be overbooking, and you should be at the airport a LOT earlier that you would normally have, probably before midnight. You want to be the first in the queue. If online/mobile check-in is possible, do it as soon as it opens. You want your boarding pass to show ""SEQ 001"".

I suppose the rescheduling is to account for additional checks on arrival (as well as thorough disinfection of the aircraft after the flight) in order not to have issues with short connections.

Current Qatar Airways procedures for flights from Iran:


  In line with various global and local health warnings, all incoming passengers from Iran and South Korea whose final destination is Doha and are showing no symptoms of the Novel Coronavirus will be asked to stay in home isolation or a quarantine facility for 14 days.
  
  Passengers arriving from those countries who are showing symptoms will be transferred to the Communicable Disease Centre at the Hamad Medical Corporation.


So if you do not show any symptoms and are only in transit, you should have no issue boarding the flight to Vienna, unless Austria implements bans or quarantines by then.

Good luck!

We received a mail today (March 2nd) saying please call our Call Center. We called and they said the flight was cancelled. They gave us the options for a refund or change. When asking which changes were possible, they offered the same flight for the 11th of March. I asked if there could be some problem because of the novel coronavirus and they said they had no information. We changed our flight to March 11th, because they said that if the same happened again and it was cancelled again we could get the refund.

Now I've learnt in IATA's list (https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm, update from March 1st) about Turkish ban of non-turkish nationals who have been to Korea recently. I think it isn't likely this ban will disappear soon (right?) so we're looking for alternatives like flights via Germany or direct flights to Barcelona.

Now I'm worried that if Turkish Airlines actually does their March 11th flight but they don't let any non-turkish nationals on, they may argue that no refund is possible because it's the passenger responsibility to check that they have all the rights to enter the countries for every layover, at the time they get the flight. Are we going to get a refund? I called the Call Center again but they said they had no information about this.

My wife is Korean but she is currently living in the EU. I think they should have known that because of my wife's nationality she was not allowed to travel. The ticket fare was the cheapest, no cancellations allowed. We had booked the 1st flight before the novel coronavirus was discovered.

The good news is, that the travel advisory does not prohibit people from transiting through Turkey.  In fact, since practically all Europe -- US flights are cancelled due to the travel bans of both countries, this is the currently the cheapest way for me to transit between the two, given that I have the right to enter both.  Get on a Turkish Airlines flight from Europe to Istanbul, and from there a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to the US.  Since Turkey is not on the travel ban of either country, the flights continue as planned.  Also, since I am not ""entering"" Turkey but merely transiting through it, this is also allowed by Turkey.

154541,Is traveling to Spain safe during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"First of all, I will honestly admit that I adopted the style of question from the following thread: 

Is traveling to Italy safe during the COVID-19 outbreak?

However, unlike Nevi, I intend to disclose personal information s.t. it can be objectively judged whether traveling to Spain is secure or not. 


I am under 28, male and have no disease or anything similar - as far as I know, anyway. 
I intended to travel to Barcelona from 15th March to 05th April, 
getting there by train via Hannover-Cologne (ICE), Cologne-Brussels (ICE),  Brussels-Paris (Thalys) and Paris-Barcelona (TGV). On the return journey: Barcelona-Paris (TGV), Paris-Frankfurt (TGV), Frankfurt-Hannover (IC). 
The plan was to go to a language school by midday and in the afternoon, get to know Barcelona itself. This trip is being offered by my scholarship that I have for my studies. 
I haven't reached out to them yet, because usually, if canceling a trip to a a language school, they require you to pay the entire fee of 1,000 € (no spelling error), unless you prove you were ill (by going to a doctor). But maybe, they make an exception due to the circumstances - I think I should reach out to them soon. 
I currently live in Germany in a big city and my dad is a taxi driver who often has guests from the airport as well, so the question is: Aren't I equally exposed to the Corona-virus in Germany, i.e. at home? 
On the 6th April, my term officially starts, and from mid-April, I wanted to start my Bachelor Thesis, so it would be great if I weren't in quarantine in April. 
Also, I care about getting the virus to my home community - I mean, who doesn't? But then, the question is, shouldn't my dad stop taxi driving for a while? I told him my opinion, but he said we need money for a living. 
I have already booked the tickets for 360€ and after having informed myself, I probably would get back only 44€. However, I understandably don't care about the money right now. 


EDIT: Alright, I searched for an alternative and found one: I could take a ""Flixbus"" from Frankfurt (Main) Central Station to Barcelona directly and vice versa. The costs for the entire trip would be around 100€, and I can get easily from Hannover to Frankfurt/from Frankfurt to Hannover with an IC(E). However, the only question is whether I have to travel or not ... I mean, if the situation should escalate in Barcelona/Spain/Europe, then I could be in quarantine and that wouldn't be great. 

EDIT EDIT: If sb wants to now, I decided to cancel my trip. I will lose around 1,050 € at least, since my scholarship isn't ready to officially cancel the trip.

",154543,"Spain itself does not seem particularly risky, it's not the country most impacted in Europe, it has fewer cases than either France or Germany, most of them tourists or imported cases and is not considered a “risk area“.

Still, there are several things to be aware of:


Traveling in general does increase your exposure (to this and other viruses), you would be spending hours in enclosed spaces and at times crowded public transportation, which, everything else being equal, is riskier than staying at home in either of the countries you would be crossing.
The itinerary you describe would have you going through France, which is developing into one of the most severely affected countries in Europe. There are several clusters whose source hasn't been fully elucidated, including one very close to Paris. At this moment, the French government does not advise against travel in general (only in the Oise and Haute-Savoie département) but the situation could evolve quickly. It did activate “stage 2” of its emergency plan meaning the virus is circulating through the population and the focus is on slowing it down rather than isolating clusters and risk areas.
If the situation worsens, you could conceivably be putting others at risk. There are few restrictions on travel in Europe and blanket bans or border closures seem unlikely but if anything, Spanish authorities should be more concerned about people like you coming from France than you should be about being in Spain.
It's possible the outbreak would develop further while you are in Spain to the point of making your return more difficult or, indeed, mean isolation would be recommended when coming back to Germany. You cannot know this before leaving (and I speak from experience as this just happened to me coming back from Italy).

Going by train would mean traveling via Cologne (Germany), Brussels, Paris (that makes me really afraid), on the return journey via Paris and Frankfurt Main (Germany). However, there is also a Flixbus directly going to Barcelona from Frankfurt. 

Though I already booked the train tickets via Paris, I could stil get a refund and thereby get most of the money back. :-) So what would you say, is it safer to travel by bus rather than by train? 

However, I was also wondering whether trains aren't equally safe as buses, since I could just stand all the time in a TGV in the floor or just sit on my luggage where there aren't so many people?
",154621,"It is somewhat hard to answer this one. You obviously concerned, but not enough to forfeit the course and cancel the trip. You are a bit afraid, but not enough so to overcome you 'flight shame' and hop on a direct plane. 

However, you are afraid enough to consider either spending a 25-hour trip on a Flixbus or a 13-hour train trip standing on the corridor. For some reason you are more afraid of Paris than Cologne or Barcelona, and more afraid of trains than buses.

At this point, my honest suggestion is that you do whatever makes you feel most comfortable. 

Given that you have already decided to travel, and to travel by either train or bus, the choice between those two matters little.

On a train, you'll be in a carriage with 120 people. A dozen or so in close proximity to you. In a bus you'll be with 60 people. A dozen or so in close proximity to you. There is no evidence that one is significantly riskier than the other.

",Reasonable,"Yes, this is possible; I have done it, though it was about a decade ago.  I can't remember which form I completed to surrender my lawful permanent resident status, but it currently seems to be an I-407.  It was surrendered when I was applying to enter the US.  Once it was done I was admitted for that trip, but strongly advised to apply for a US B1/B2 visa even though I'm a citizen of a visa-waiver country.

When I did apply, after my return home, the application process was thorough, but it seemed fair, and the visa was approved.  However, I don't think the US government plays games like ""I'd like to surrender this green card, but only on condition that I get a visa"", so you are taking the risk that your visa(s) won't be approved, and you'll find yourselves unable to visit your daughter.  Note also that visas can be pretty easily revoked, which is not true for LPR status, and that possession of a visa is no guarantee of admission.  You'd be putting yourself at the whims of the current US president and his tendency to make decrees affecting the travel of citizens of arbitrary nations, and you may not wish to do that.

You could try if you can find your PNRs on the Trenitalia website. But I do not know if you could cancel your tickets there. Cancelling tickets you should do via the agent you booked them with. 

If you created a login with bahn.de you should be able to see your orders there, and maybe cancel them, and you can otherwise just email them. 

But you also may just be out of luck. I had to cancel a trip to Germany because of the COVID-19 situation, and I am not getting any refunds either. See if your travel insurance will refund them. 
",Reasonable,"For flights, it could be problematic and would depend on where you are flying to and from, your citizenship, and the experience and mood of the staff checking you in.  

In such cases, the airline staff that check you in have a certain amount of discretion and for some journeys, they may well allow it, just as they would allow a case of first name, initial, last name.

In other cases, some airlines may seize on the opportunity to levy an additional charge at checkin to change the name to match.  I have had this before when 2 letters in my name were transposed.  A US$250 typo!

Many airports now require self check-in.  A machine is almost certainly not going to allow you to pass without intervention from an airline representative. 

One specific problem situation may arise if you are not a U.S. citizen and are attempting to board a flight to the U.S.  In this case, it is unlikely that any airline would take the risk of allowing you to board.  The reason being the huge amount of passenger data that the U.S. government requires, and the amount of checks and pre-processing that is done.  If the airline perceives any risk that a discrepancy could cause you to be denied entry to the U.S. (or any other country for that matter), then they will not allow you to board.

154755,Should I bother cancelling if the traveller is planning not to show up for a flight?,"As part of my job, I helped my university to buy
an airline ticket for a student from city A to city B.
Due to the COVID-19 disease outbreak,
the student decided that it was too risky to travel,
and so he/she will remain in city A.

I noticed the following text in the electronic ticket:


  TICKET IS NON-REFUNDABLE
  
  NO SHOW PENALTY AT USD 250 PER TICKET


Questions:


Will my university or the student have to pay a no-show penalty
if he/she does not show up for the flight?
Should I take the effort to cancel the tickets with the airline?

Since the tickets are non-refundable,
I am assuming that my university will not get any money back for cancelling the tickets,
so there does not seem to be any benefit to us for cancelling the tickets.


(Note: city B is not yet a super high risk destination for COVID-19,
so I don't foresee the airline allowing a full refund for the airline tickets.)



I explain what I decided to do in the answer below.
",154764,"Non-refundable doesn't mean what you seem to assume - it does not mean that the money is lost. It means that you don't get it back.

That might seem an irrelevant difference, but often it is not - you can use the value of the ticket for further bookings with the airline (for the same flier, not just anybody).
If you cancel the ticket, you typically have 365 days (from day of payment, not day of flight) to use the value for another booking.

The no-show fee is a fee that gets taken out of your remaining value - if the flier simply doesn't show up (instead of cancelling), he will not get the full ticket value parked, but it will be reduced by the no-show fee.
So you should definitely cancel, as it will save the no-show fee. Only if the person is not going to fly within a full year is the ticket value completely lost.
",Reasonable,"I think the key word in your initial statement is that you heard about it.  The fact that this occurred was deemed serious enough that it made it to the international news outlets.  Now, of course, that's not to say that every such incident makes the news, but it does mean that such incidents are obviously rare or there would be more than very occasional such incidents being reported.

Unfortunately discrimination can and does occur on airlines, just like it occurs in most parts of the world - but the odds of it escalating to the point of you being kicked off the plane or your wife being forced to remove her headscarf would be so low as to be considered zero on most airlines and in most countries around the world.

Specific to your wife's head covering, there are situations where she could be asked to remove it, but this should be done in a private area.  For example, here are the USA's TSA comments on head coverings.

As far as what you can do to minimize the chances of an incident, the only advice I could give would be the same that I'd give to any passenger, regardless of race or religion - consider the feelings of everyone else on the plane, and try not to do anything that would cause any undue impact or concerns to others on the plane.  For example, there was a recent report of a passenger praying whilst on a plane, which people took offence at - not for religious reasons, but because in doing so he was blocking access to the aisles and toilets.

Similarly I would probably not recommend you decide to start speaking Arabic to another passenger located on the other side of the plane (ie, at a high volume) - just as I would not recommend a passenger shout out a welcome to his friend Jack on the other side of the plane (""Hi Jack!"").

In a perfect world, such discrimination would not exist, but the simple fact is it does. As much as I hate to give advice to try and minimize your profile in places such as (Western) airports and aircraft, the simple fact is that doing so will likely result in an easier trip for you.

",154850,"EDIT: This is a fast evolving situation. Under the current circumstances I suggest anyone planning to come to Europe just cancel or postpone. 

A Schengen visa normally allows one to enter any Schengen country. 
There is no obligation to enter the Schengen area through the country that issued your visa. 
So entering via France (or any other country) is not an issue. 
It is pretty common even.

The rule that you must apply to the consulate of the country that is your main destination exists to spread the workload, and to counter visa shopping. 
To enforce that rule the immigration officer stamping you in may want to see hotel and flight reservations proving that indeed you plan to follow the itinerary on your Schengen Visa application. 
Arriving at the border with evidence suggesting that your plans are very different from those stated in your application will raise red flags, and may lead to a refusal.

This under normal circumstances. 
However we are no longer under normal circumstances. 
Deciding to no longer visit Italy is completely reasonable in light of the current situation. 
So I would guess that cutting Italy out of your plans is not going to raise a red flag. 
You should however inquire with the French consulate and the  French border police (dcpaf-em-cnic@interieur.gouv.fr).

One last thing: 
The way things are currently progressing all of Europe will be where Italy is now in about 10 days (and so might your home country).

",Reasonable,"Ethiopia was formerly a fully state-controlled, Marxist economy and despite slow liberalization, many sectors remain government controlled.  This includes aviation, where Ethiopian Airlines has a de facto monopoly on domestic flights.  Hence fares are both high and fixed: it's a legacy of state control and there's no competition.

That said, it may apparently be possible to score cheaper flights via travel agencies in Ethiopia, so it may be worth exploring other options.  Bear in mind that Internet penetration in Ethiopia also remains low, so if your schedule is flexible, it might make sense to do this after arrival.

Incidentally, Ethiopia is not alone in this pricing scheme, I recall running into the same system in eg. Laos and a number of Central Asian countries as well.  Often there's a dual pricing system that charges top dollar for foreigners and has subsidized pricing for locals, but I'm not sure if this is the case for Ethiopia as well.  (Update: It appears this is indeed the case, with a 66% discount for residents &amp; people traveling to/from Ethiopia on Ethiopian Airlines.)

",154880,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: When and how to use masks


If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.
Wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing.
Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.

Protection measures for everyone
Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:


Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand
rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

",Reasonable,"These are just my guesses as a system developer working with fraud detection.



Since the e-Gates are using the image (stored in the chip) in your passport, two people having faces looking almost the same and going through the gates so soon after each other should trigger a warning.

To solve this you could do plastic surgery or maybe use different flights so that the time between using the e-Gates is larger. I guess the timeout could be just 5 minutes.

You could also try wearing a hat, glasses or makeup.



I actually have the exact same image in both my passport and my EU National ID Card. If they were to be used within 5 minutes of each other, the 2nd should also be declined. But say I leave the country and then come back and use my other ID, I should be let in.

I got the same image in both as I applied for both at the same time. They're pretty cheap in Sweden.

154910,How does the US COVID-19 travel ban apply to the EU spouse of a US citizen?,"I am a French citizen, legally married to a US citizen. I currently live in Germany while my husband lives in the US.

I was supposed to fly to the US on Sunday (March 15) on a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to visit my husband in the US for two weeks (until March 30). I am wondering if I can still get on the flight, and whether I should.

It is clear in the presidential proclamation that the travel restriction does not apply to spouses of US citizens. However I wonder how this is enforced. I travel with my French passport and an ESTA (visa waiver), I do not have any spouse visa or anything. Is it the airline who decides to let me on the flight? Or is it up to the immigration officer once I arrive in the US?

I also don't know if the flight is going to be cancelled. As far as the flight status shows, it is not cancelled, but I wouldn't trust that.

To make matters more difficult for myself, I got a United reservation through Chase's travel rewards program for a flight operated by Lufthansa. If the flight is cancelled or I cannot get on it, any idea who I should turn to for reimbursement? So far I have not been able to get a hold of Lufthansa customer service, they must be overloaded. I have not yet tried United or Chase.

Sorry this is such a specific and self-interested question, I just thought some of you might have similar situations or more information to share.
",154911,"There are still a lot of unknowns at this stage, so it is quite difficult to answer with any degree of certainty.


I expect you would need to be able to prove to someone (probably the airline, and then again CBP upon arrival in the US) that you are the spouse of a US citizen. Make sure you have a copy of your marriage certificate or other similar document, as well as a copy of your husband's passport.
There is a strong probability that many flights will be cancelled, though as US citizens and their immediate family are still allowed to travel to the US, there should still be a few flights. Which ones will be operating and which ones will be cancelled is the one million dollar question. You'll have to wait for Lufthansa to make a decision, taking into account that this could change quite late.


I expect airlines to get in touch with passengers to:


Inform them of these new measures, and the exact details of what documents are required/allowed.
Probably ask information so they know which passengers are still able to travel or not, which in turn will let them decide how many flights to keep, and which ones.


Given the surprise announcement, they're probably scrambling to make all of that happen.

If the flight is cancelled, you should be eligible for a refund. You should probably contact Chase at that point.

If the flight is NOT cancelled but you decide not to travel, we enter in the very gray area that the airline is probably not legally required to refund your ticket. They will most probably instead propose rebooking at a later date or the like. The fact that it's an award ticket may change things (is the ticket refundable?). Again, Chase is probably the right point of contact for this.

EDIT

The Lufthansa Group have announced the cancellation of all but 6 flights to/from the US from March 14th:


  The Lufthansa Group will continue operating flights from:
  
  
  Frankfurt to Chicago and Newark (New York)
  Zurich to Chicago and Newark (New York)
  Vienna to Chicago and from
  Brussels to Washington
  
  
  beyond 14 March, thus maintaining at least some air traffic connections to the USA from Europe. The airlines are currently working on an alternative flight schedule for the USA. Passengers will still be able to reach all destinations within the USA via the U.S. hubs and connecting flights served by our partner airline, United Airlines.
  
  All other U.S. flights will be suspended until further notice due to U.S. administration restrictions, including all departures from Munich, Düsseldorf and Geneva. The Lufthansa Group will continue to serve all destinations in Canada until further notice.

",Reasonable,"There is no immigration leaving the USA (apart from random spot checks).

The only people that will look at your passport are the check-in staff and TSA will check your passport details(name) against your ticket before security.

You also do not pass through immigration on internal flights in the USA.

",154924,"Insurance premium

You can cancel the insurance at any time before the coverage begins.  The company website says


  Before the beginning of coverage, ... you can request a full refund at any time. 


Visa application fee

Your visa fee is probably lost, but you might try asking if you can adjust your application dates.  I wouldn't hold my breath.

Air fare

Rebooking

Subject to some conditions, you can probably rebook the air tickets without change fees:


  SWISS will waive its rebooking fees for all newly booked flights worldwide with immediate effect and until March 31 and offer a one-off free rebooking. For existing bookings, the new waiver policy will apply worldwide to all flights booked by March 5 with a departure date up to April 30, 2020. Passengers will thus be able to rebook their flight ticket once to a new date up to December 31, 2020 without incurring any rebooking fee.


As noted by Mark Johnson in a comment, this policy applies to the entire Lufthansa Group.

Refund

If you're lucky enough that your flight is cancelled, however, you might get a refund:


  For cancelled flights: If you have booked through swiss.com or a Service Centre and you don't want to rebook your flight ticket, you can refund your ticket. To do so, please complete the refund form.
  
  If you booked through an (online) travel agency, please contact the travel agency.


I say ""might"" because I don't know whether you'd be able to get a refund if the flight is cancelled after you rebook it.

Taxes and fees

Even if you cannot recover your airfare, you should be entitled to a refund of certain taxes and fees for flights that you didn't actually take.

Possible insurance claims

If you have any travel insurance or other general insurance, you may want to look at whether it would cover any losses you incur.  Again, I wouldn't hold my breath, but it's better to check now rather than to find out after the claim deadline has passed that you might have been eligible for reimbursement.

154925,Can 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic be a reason for refusal for my Schengen visa application?,"I'm planning a trip to the Netherlands mid-April, and I've already made reservations. I understand that because of the current coronavirus pandemic, I may have to postpone my trip or cancel it entirely.

However, instead of deciding now, I'd like to decide later (in April) if I should continue with my trip plans or cancel it (depending on travel advisories issued by my country (India) and the Netherlands, which would apply at that time). Which requires that I proceed with my visa application now (as I must apply at least 15 working days earlier). I understand that it is quite likely that I may have to cancel or postpone my trip (the global travel situation seems unlikely to get better by next month, but I want to stay optimistic, or at least not regret that I could have applied for visa in March if situations in mid-April do get favourable for a trip).

My concern is if the current coronavirus pandemic can be cited as a reason for visa refusal by the Netherlands embassy. I.e., does the current pandemic increase the likelihood of visa refusal when compared to normal circumstances? Are there any rules in visa policy of Schengen Area that concern with situations like this?

UPDATE: To clarify, my concern here is if the current pandemic will increase the likelihood of visa refusal. (Whether or not I'll be able to travel to the Netherlands in April is a different issue). The reason I'm separating these two concerns is because with new EU visa rules, I may qualify for a long validity visa (as I've been issued multiple Schengen visas in past), so if in the unfortunate case I've to postpone my April trip, I can do so &amp; re-plan on a much shorter notice. Whereas if I don't apply for a visa now and do so later, I'll have to plan for weeks in advance again (as I must apply for a visa 15 working days / 3 weeks in advance).

UPDATE: If the Netherlands issues a travel restriction in near future, will that result in a visa refusal or application rejection?
",154932,"There are restrictions in place, but AFAIK no current restrictions for Indian citizens/residents applying for Dutch visa. On the other hand, the Czech Republic closed their visa processing centers in China and Hong Kong several weeks ago, effectively preventing residents of China from applying for a Czech visa. It is at the moment difficult to predict what happens tomorrow or in the next days, but it is of course not impossible, that more Schengen countries will follow and impose restrictions on visa issuance.

Independent of the visa, it may also by mid-April be impossible to travel to the Netherlands. Several Schengen countries have today or in the past few days established very strict travel regulations or bans, effectively preventing many or most tourists and visitors from entering.
",Reasonable,"Whatever happens, if you apply right now, your chances of getting a visa will be best. If your application is rejected because of Coronavirus fears, that wouldn't be held against you in the future.

Now due to  the quarantine mandate issued by the Norway government to all foreign nationals entering Norway it's difficult to complete the norway part of our tour. we had a Finnair Flight via Helsinki to Norway and we were leaving from Helsinki after 2 days stay there. 
Under this unusual situation is it possible that we do the entire tour in Finland without visiting Norway at all. Schengen visa has been issued by Norway.
this is an unusual situation as we will be compelled to be in quarantine irrespective of the health status in Norway. so there is no use in visiting the country. But we also do not want to cancel our plan. so checking out and need advice whether we can do the entire tour in Finland though originally Finland constituted a lesser part of our tour.
",154941,"I must say that nobody knows what's going to happen and that the situation is developing quickly in Europe.

First I would suggest that you talk to your airline.  Normally if you miss a single segment then the whole rest of your trip (including your return) would be cancelled automatically.

Given the circumstances then the airlines are generally being very flexible, but you must first check what they will and will not allow and then change your itinery accordingly and not just not take a flight.  

Next (or in parrallel) I would suggest contacting your local Finnish embassy and explaining the situation.  Tell them that your Schengen visa was issued by Norway, that you are flying via Helsinki anyway and would now like to spend the enture trip there rather than the couple of days you previously planned.  And then ask if they would, given the circumstances, allow you to enter and remain therer for xx days.

It really depends on how flexible they are.
They might allow this.  They might say that you should get a new visa issued.  They might reduce or waive the cost.  But you should check first.

If I was you, I would also consider making alternative plans.  Talk to the airline about rescheduling the trip, as it is likely that they will allow you to do this free of charge at the moment.

Only you can judge if this is a worthwhile trip for you given the cirumstances.
My personal opinion is that the next two weeks are going to get worse, and it will be awhile before the situation improves.

154945,"People exempt from Trump's COVID-19 proclamation, what is the quarantine/screening requirement?","You can read President Trump's full proclamation regarding conditions of travel between the US and Schengen zone here. Nowhere in this proclamation is a mention of a quarantine.

However, several major news outlets seem to be reporting different (and contradictory) things.

BBC reports: 


  Under President Donald Trump, the federal government has banned
  non-citizens from coronavirus-hit regions entry, but US citizens are
  allowed back into the country after a two-week quarantine.


Yet, CNN says 


  Returning travelers will be screened prior to entering the US and asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.


My question is, which is it? Will people exempt by the restriction face a mandated quarantine at the airport, or be told to self-quarantine? Nowhere in the official proclamation do I see mention of screening (which I am all for). If one of these people who is exempt from the restriction passes the screening (negative for the virus), are they free to go?

Basically, they will have to arrive in the US at one of 13 designated airports, where they will undergo medical examination. If they have no symptoms, they will be asked to self-monitor their health and limit interactions (the government also calls this ""self-quarantine"") until 14 days after they have left the Schengen Area, but there are no formal restrictions on where they can go.

Only people who have been to Hubei province within the last 14 days are subject to a formal, mandatory quarantine so far.

Until you announce to the USA government that you have completed transition and provide documentation, they will not unilaterally change your sex in the records.

Thus your travel documents with previous sex still holds valid until you officially effect those changes when you return to the USA.

Your sex is not officially determined by your appearance. We are long past that period of stereotyping based purely on looks. There are many people who look like the opposite sex. Also there are many people who look radically different from their passport pictures including people who have transitioned but have not yet reassigned their official gender.

In conclusion, regardless of how your friend looks now and how different his/her appearance is from what is on her official documents, he/she will be let in if he/she can prove with documentation that she/he is who she/he claims he/she is. Yes you will spend a little longer at immigration on arrival and when checking in at the departure airport however this is nothing new.

In general, it is not advised to finalize travel arrangements before a visa is issued. 

Some application forms explicitly state 'if known' when asking for an accommodation address, others don't.  

The Schengen Border Code does not state that suppling an address, upon application for a visa, is mandatory. 

You will, no doubt, be suppling a letter from your home institution in Russia.   

This letter, or in a second letter, should state that they will be organizing the travel and accommodation arrangements.   

If this letter also states that they prefer to do this after the application is granted, then it should be clear to the Embassy or Consulate why the field has not been filled. 

What is important is that the accommodation address must be known when entering the Schengen Area.

155022,How do you 'self-isolate' in a hostel dorm room?,"NZ, Aus and other countries are now requiring people to self-isolate for 14 days to ensure they don't have Covid-19.  There can be some rather strict ramifications if you fail to adhere to this.

What I wondered after seeing a question on FB (disclaimer: I run the beatthatflight facebook page) - how does one self isolate as a backpacker/traveller who is planning on staying in hostel dorms??
",155025,"Go home if you can!

If you are travelling in your country of residence, go home and self-isolate there.  If travel restrictions make this impossible, contact the relevant authorities for advise.  Usually there are some exemptions for essential travel, and travelling from a potentially crowded hostel to your home may well count as valid travel.

If you are travelling in another country than your country of residence, contact your embassy.  Many embassies are attempting to repatriate their citizens.  Chances are your embassy is already working on trying to reach you if they know how to contact you (I received an email from my government already, but I have my home and job here and the situation in my mother country is no better than here, so it makes no sense for me to repatriate).

Now is not the time to travel for non-essential purposes.
",Reasonable,"With current occupancy rates, I'd expect you to have high likelihood of being alone in the dorm room and thus being able to self-isolate.

155030,COVID-19: some EU countries closed borders for foreigners - are EU citizens foreigners?,"A lot of countries in the EU are now closing their borders due to COVID-19.

I'm looking for an answer that applies to all such EU countries that have shut their borders for ""foreigners"", however, to use some example for my question, Poland states:


  Entry into Poland is still allowed for:
  
  a)               Nationals of Poland, their spouses and children.
  
  c)                Passengers with a temporary or permanent residence permit.


Now, as a not-Polish citizen but a citizen of another EU country, my understanding has always been that by default we have a temporary residence permit for any EU country we would like to travel to? (And obviously after 5 years we automatically get a permanent residence permit if stayed in the country)

Does this count as having a temporary residence permit (if I don't normally live in such country but would like to travel or transit there as a EU citizen)? 



P.S. There's a similar text for Czechia, Lithuania, Slovakia which is not as vague as Poland's:


  Passengers are not allowed to enter Czechia.
  
  - This does not apply to nationals of Czechia.
  
  - This does not apply to passengers with a Czech residence permit for stay over 90 days or for permanent stay.

155054,Can I get a refund for COVID-19 related cancellations?,"In the current situation, many people will have to cancel existing flight or hotel bookings, and would like to get a refund.

In which cases can one get a refund?
",155055,"There are many specific rules which will vary based on at least:


the country where the property or airline is based
the point of departure or the destination of the flight
the country where you reside
the original cancellation terms of the booking
whether you bought flights and hotels separately or not
who you bought the flights and/or hotel from
whether they were bought as part of group bookings / blocks
other specific details.


But, in general, the following apply:


If your flight is cancelled by the airline, then you should in general be eligible for a refund.


For flights covered by the EU Flight Compensation Regulation EC261/2004, i.e. all flights departing from an EU/EEA member state or operated by an airline based in an EU/EEA member state, this is explicitly stated in Article 8 of the regulation.

Given that there are exceptional circumstances, no compensation is due. However, you must still be given the option of a refund, though one can accept rerouting or rebooking.

As airlines are cash-strapped, they will try to convince you to take a voucher instead of a refund. You can agree to it if you want, but they cannot force you to do so. Remember that many airlines will fail due to this situation. A failed airline cannot honour a voucher or a rebooking (though it's quite probable quite a few will fail before owed refunds are paid).

Airlines are required to refund you within 7 days. Given the very large number of queries they are receiving at this time, and the precarious financial situation they are in, it will probably take much longer, though, and in many cases any appeal will take enough time for the airline to have failed before you get paid.
For other cancelled flights not covered by EC261, the rule should be the same (they couldn't provide the service, so they should provide a refund), but this will be governed by local laws and/or the airlines terms &amp; conditions (conditions of carriage).
Note that several other countries implement rules very similar (or even identical) to EC261, including Turkey, Georgia, Moldova, Serbia and Ukraine.
Note that you should only ask for the refund if you are at home. If you are stranded in a foreign country, getting a refund may complicate things a lot to secure alternate travel. Though EC261 requires the airline to provide both the refund and a return flight ""at the earliest opportunity"", in many cases the return flight you want may not be operated by the airline but via some other scheme.

If however your flight has not (yet) been cancelled, and you decide to change your plans, then you do not have the right to a full refund (unless the fare was fully refundable, of course). In theory, the original terms of your fare should apply (including fares being non-refundable, penalties, etc.). Most airlines will however offer to either rebook for free or provide a voucher valid for future travel (usually valid for a year). Note that in many cases, the rebooking options or voucher validity will be limited to one year from the original purchase date. I doubt any will offer a refund in this case.

This applies also if you change your plans because the situation at the destination is no longer suitable, or you will not be able to get to your hotel, or the conference or event you were planning to attend has been cancelled, or you are stuck in yet another country due to the current travel restrictions, etc. As long as it's not the airline cancelling the flight, no refunds are due.
The case of countries suddenly closing their borders to some categories of people (e.g. the US refusing entry to anyone having gone through the Schengen Area, UK, or Ireland in the past 14 days) probably falls in the last category: as long as the flight still operates, the airline usually is not required to provide a refund.
Airlines will often proactively suggest you rebook your travel or get a voucher. Once you have accepted that option, you are no longer eligible for a refund even if the flight you originally booked ends up being cancelled.
For hotels, the rules are basically the same, though I'm not aware of any blanket legislation like EC261:


If the hotel cancels the booking (because they will be closed or completely inaccessible), you should in general be eligible for a refund, even if the fare was non-refundable.
If the hotel is still able to honour your booking, but you just can't get there (because there are no flights, borders are closed, you're stuck in another country, region or city) or no longer want to get there (you no longer want to travel, the event you wanted to attend has been cancelled...), then you are in general not eligible for a refund.

Here again, the hotel may apply the original rules of the booking (no refunds or changes at all), or they can (and many will) allow for a rebooking at a later date or a voucher. But ultimately, that is their choice.

Travel booked as a ""package"" (flight + hotel, sometimes other components as well) sold by a travel agent or tour operator usually have additional protections, especially those sold by EU companies. Most importantly, if the flight is cancelled or the hotel at the destination is unreachable/closed, one is eligible for a refund of the whole package, whereas when both are booked separately, one may be able to get a refund for one but not the other.
Added 18/3/2020 In some places, the government has changed the rules, and explicitly authorises some actors to not refund, and instead only provide a voucher valid for one year. See this answer for Belgium for such an exemple.


Let's add that this is were travel insurance should come into play, but double-check any exclusions and conditions that may apply. Also, don't forget that you may have multiple travel insurances: many credit cards have a travel insurance automatically included for all travel bought using the card. Check the conditions and exclusions of any that may apply (you can of course only get refunded by a single one).
",Reasonable,"As usual, it depends. I haven't been to all Philippines (only to 14 or so cities), so take this with a grain of salt.

Every public toilet I used there was reasonably clean. Most weren't exactly as shown on your link, and some (for example on a local market in Cebu) didn't have running water (there's a bucket of water nearby and you flush with a ladle), but it didn't look or felt filthy. From my experience it's similar to Thailand, and way above a typical toilet in India.

What was common, however, was the lack of toilet paper. Even paid toilets sometime (not always) had only tissues, and usually for extra fee - although minor.

And as you guess, pay toilets and those closer to touristy areas are generally cleaner and more stocked.

155074,What happens to my Schengen visa application being processed during coronavirus?,"I submitted my application a week ago, before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared.

I am just wondering whether they can reject my application because of coronavirus, or would they still issue me a visa but advise me not to travel?

I had applied for the Netherlands. 
",155096,"This is a very dynamic and unprecedented situation, so nobody knows for sure what will happen.  So below is more of an opinion rather than known fact.

As it currently stands, travel into the 26 EU states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, is prohibited for 30 days and as such travel is banned for all non-EU citizens or residents (except UK citizens).

Assuming your travel request falls within this period then the following is likely.


They could reject you current application and tell you to reapply in
the future.  That this rejection will not be looked upon negatively
when you apply, and you should get a full refund of any fees paid.
Or they could put your application on hold and ask you in the future
if you wish to proceed or not with new dates.  If not, then you would
get a full refund.
They could approve your visa, but issue it with different dates and/or
an extended travel period.  e.g.  instead of 90 in 180 days, then 90
in 270 days.


If your travel request is for later than this period then the following could occur:


Issue the visa but advise you that you will only be able to travel if
the borders reopen.  If the borders don't reopen in time, you have to
apply again.  You may or may not have to pay the fees again in such a case.
Stop processing and ask you if you wish to postpone or withdraw your
application, and refund the fees
Stop processing temporarily.  Continue processing when the situation
improves, if your application is far enough in the future
Reject the application, and tell you to reapply again when the situation is clearer.  Refund the fees.


If the visa is rejected due to the Corona shutdown, then it will not be looked upon negatively when you apply again in the future and you should get a full refund.
",Reasonable,"This happens quite regularly for multi-carrier trips. Less so for single carrier trips.

Airline search algorithms are often inferior

For single carrier trips, it's almost always because the airline's search algorithm doesn't find the trip you want, not because the airline doesn't sell it.

If the search tool is an in-house product, it may be inferior in an absolute sense compared to something like ITA's QPX search, which many OTAs now use. Writing a search algorithm for airline flights is a terrifically hard problem (formally it is classed as ""undecidable""), and airlines don't hire the kind of computer scientists who can solve it efficiently. Specialists like ITA have hundreds of computer scientists.

Alternatively, an airline's search may be tuned with different preferences to an OTA. A lot of airlines try to avoid overnight stops, even if that would be preferable to three flights at a higher price. I would guess that's the cause of your SAS problem here.

Solutions


Try the multicity search, and put some of the connecting cities in as if they were stopovers. When you choose the dates, choose the dates that you'll actually fly that leg. This is often a good bet, but it sometimes causes the airline to price your trip with a fare break point at the stopover (i.e., as a sum of one way fares instead of a single through fare): Iberia.com is particularly terrible for this shortcut. However, I notice SAS has helpfully removed its multicity feature as part of the dumbing down exercise that makes the rest of its webpage unusable on a real computer.
Bookwithmatrix or Google Flights can sometimes link you directly to the desired itinerary on the airline's site. (If you do this on aa.com, you'll find that you get kicked out at the payment stage if your credit card's address isn't in the United States. But it turns out AA doesn't actually validate the country field, so you can just leave it set to United States.)
Call the airline, tell them what flight numbers you want to fly, and give them the price you expect. There is usually a telephone booking fee for doing this, although if you have some status with the airline it might be waived, particularly if you explain their website was not good enough to do it online. I used to have a friend at the Amsterdam ticketing desk for British Airways. In what I consider a crowning achievement some years ago, I constructed a price for a trip from information on expertflyer.com that was 50% lower than his system or any OTA admitted, and after some back and forth with revenue management, he agreed it was a bug in their pricing system and sold me the itinerary at the lower price. :-)



  (and if so, would this be standard practice, or should I expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline?)


BA, AA, KLM, 90% success rate, sometimes have to hang up and call again. Qantas, JAL, Cathay Pacific, their telephone staff and ticket desks are always reliable. Air France, maybe 50%. Iberia, Alitalia, LATAM: total waste of time. 

Point-of-sale differences in inventory

Sometimes, additional inventory is available in the city where the travel agent is based, compared to where the airline is calculating the price. To understand why that can be the case, you should know that ""how many seats left for sale on a plane"" is a function of the sales city as well as other factors. Airline websites, in my experience, usually price from the city of origin, whereas agents usually price from a fixed point. One way to see this is from the payment currency, which will invariably be the currency of the sales city. For instance expedia.fr prices out of Paris, regardless of whether the itinerary passes through that city.

This only seems to matter when the flight is filling up.

Ticket issuance restrictions in the fare

Sometimes, the airline really cannot sell you the trip. This may be because the trip comprises multiple fares and one of the fares has a restriction that it must be issued ""on the stock"" of a ticket airline. Stock here refers to the old fashioned 4-part carbon paper tickets, but the concept is directly implemented in electronic ticketing. For instance, looking at a cheap S7 fare from London to Yekaterinburg:

Category 15: Sales restrictions
  TICKETS MUST BE ISSUED ON S7.
         NOTE -
          SALES PERMITTED ON TICKET STOCK VALIDATED OR
          PLATED S7/421 ONLY.


Even though a BA plane will fly you the first leg from London to Moscow, BA could not sell you a journey involving this particular fare. Airlines always sell tickets on their own ""paper"", not as agents for another airline; in this case, BA sells tickets on BA plate (ticket number starting ""125-"") and S7 sells tickets on S7 plate (ticket number starting ""421-""). But a travel agent could pick any validating carrier with whom it has a ticketing agreement, subject to the fare rules and the agreement. So the travel agent has some additional flexibility. 

This really only matters when you have a particularly complicated trip with multiple airlines who don't partner together very closely.

  Normally she would enter on a 90 days tourist visa, as we don't yet have a long term family reunification visa.


Your wife will never get a long-term family reunification visa because such visas are not issued to beneficiaries of the free movement directive.

As a beneficiary from a so-called ""Annex II"" country (that is, a country whose citizens do not need a visa for short visits), your wife is supposed to enter without a visa and then apply for a residence card after entering Germany.

The trick, of course, is to find specific information about how the travel ban is being applied to non-EU citizens who enjoy freedom of movement through a family relationship but who do not yet reside in Germany.  This may be difficult as the number of such cases is probably small and the possibility may not have been considered by the people writing the policies.

the best I have been able to find so far is at https://www.germany.info/us-en/coronavirus/2317268 (emphasis added):


  EU-citzens and citizens of Great Brtain, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland and their family members will be allowed to transit through Germany to reach their home countries.


This suggests that beneficiaries of the free movement directive are included among those who may enter Germany.  Your wife might want to say that Germany is her place of residence (which is arguably true) but that she hasn't yet lived there long enough to get a residence card (which is certainly true).  Alternatively, she should call the German authorities and ask them what to tell the airline.  To that end, see How to contact border authorities in EU/Schengen countries? on this site.

Regarding the documents, you might try asking the airline if they will pass them to her when she gets off the plane.  My wife was in a similar situation recently, and that was the solution.

Part of this process was that the airline employee in the destination airport made a note in the airline's system that the documents were sufficient.  This was necessary for her to be able to board the plane without having the documents with her.  This may also prove necessary in your wife's case.

155115,Is there any way to travel from Germany to Austria by train?,"I am trying to travel to Austria from Brussels by train, and have conflicting information on the status of cancellations due to Covid-19.

Yet, Deutsche Bahn and the 'trainline.eu' both allow me to book high-speed ICE trains across the border, just not the Nightjet trains. There are notices saying that there are delays/reduced services expected at the border, but it is not impossible to book like it is for other trains.

My questions:


does this mean that it is still possible to take the high-speed ICE trains?

In case the trains stop running before you make it to Austria: If you are eligible to enter Austria, nothing should stop you from entering by taxi (or, taking a taxi to the german side of the border, crossing the border by foot, ordering another taxi to pick you up at the austrian side of the border) - but depending on how close to the border you can get by train this can be quite expensive.

My question is: I have a one year valid OPT (optional practical training). Can I get a new visa for the OPT?
",155225,"CWOP stands for cancelled without prejudice.  The phrase without prejudice means that the reason for cancellation is not to have a negative impact on your future applications for visas or for admission to the US.

Therefore, you ought to be able to apply for a new visa.  However, I am not sure what the rules are surrounding OPT (for that, you should ask at Expatriates), so there may be something going on with that that would prevent it.

The odd thing here, however, is that visas are usually cancelled without prejudice in response to some sort of administrative action.  For example, when one applies for a new visa before the old one is expired, the old visa will be cancelled without prejudice.  A visa cancellation while the bearer is en route to the US would normally be a cancellation with prejudice, because the bearer has been found inadmissible for some reason.

On the other hand, if you were prevented from flying to the US because of the travel ban related to COVID-19, I would think that your visa should not have been cancelled at all.

So I wonder whether there is some additional fact that you haven't mentioned that might explain exactly what happened.  If so, that might also have a bearing on the likelihood that a future visa application would succeed.
",Reasonable,"After seeing my comment on this question, @GayotFow shared his view of the issue via his blog, about the refusal of your fiancés Marriage Visitor Visa (MVV).  


  The OP is a British national whose fiance is in India and they want to use an MVV for the fiance to come the UK and get married.  This throws up a flag right off the bat…
  
  Background.  The MVV was invented in 2005 because Parliament found a no other way to accommodate a specific scenario:  A couple where both parties were non-EU nationals want to come to the UK and get married at a destination venue (such as a romantic castle in Scotland) and then leave the UK. The hospitality lobby had successfully argued that without a visa like this the hotel and catering industry would suffer a loss of revenue. So this visa was created and enacted.
  
  British nationals who want to marry a non-EU spouse are meant to use the existing fiance visa rules given in Appendix FM.  But these rules have a hefty fee attached to them and therein lies the confusion.  People look at the various options and see that a UK fiance visa fee is about GBP 1,500, whereas the fee for an MVV is only about GBP 90.  So the MVV is obviously the way to go, right?
  
  Well, no.  The fiance visa gives the holder the right to stay in the UK lawfully once the couple are married and then to apply from within the UK for a spouse visa. The holder of a spouse visa can take employment, and receive permanent residence (indefinite leave to remain, or ILR) after 5 years. And then they can apply for British nationality on the next day!  The holder of an MVV gets none of those things.
  
  But for some, it’s worth the difference in price to come to the UK, get married, and then use Article 8 (human rights) to remain in the UK.  When this happens, the path to ILR is extended to 10 years. Of course the applicant’s credibility is stained, but for lots of people this aspect doesn’t mean very much as they are just starting out in life.  I have been saying that it may be worth it for a very small number of cases, but 10 years is an awfully long time to hold out in a perilous immigration status with a new marriage. But if it works, it works, right?
  
  Well, sort of. But if the strategy is to get in cheaply and to use Article 8, then the SVV costs the same and leaves their credibility largely intact, or at least more so than the outright abuse of an MVV.
  
  Anyway, back to topic…
  
  Reading the refusal notice I find myself repeating the mantra that “ECO’s are not idiots”. Here we have two people who want to get married. Option 1 is to send the Brit to India, get married, and return to the UK. Option 2 is to send the Indian to the UK, get married, and (optimistically stated) return to India.  Any way you cut it Option 1 is somewhere between GBP 300 – GBP 400 cheaper than Option 2.  So what’s the rationale for wanting Option 2?  How is it that somebody with GBP 169 in the bank proposes to spend 300 – 400 pounds more to accomplish the same thing? Unless it’s to accomplish something different.  Or is the ECO not supposed to notice those things?  I suppose there’s an explanation that justifies an irrational plan like that, but they didn’t include it in the application.
  
  Next we come to the point Giorgio raised… they instructed a solicitor, this is great and part of my standing advice for over two decades.  So what in heaven’s name are they doing on the net asking random strangers for ideas and advice?  eh? EH?
  
  Finally (and perhaps mercifully) we arrive at my final nitpick.  In comments, the OP writes…
  
  
    He would be arriving in March, or the end of February (depending on if the application is approved) and we would leave for India together at the end of April/beginning of May as he has examinations in May
  
  
  Let’s do the arithmetic. 7 days residency required in order to give notice plus 28 – 70 days for the notice period (more if something is turned up).  That gives us somewhere between 35 to 77 days before the marriage can take place. Then add 3 – 5 days slippage to book the celebrant. His exams in India start in May.  The rest is left as an exercise for the reader.


Bottom line: as a UK citizen, use of this route is abusive, which a solicitor versed in UK immigration law will recognize. A second application in the same category will likely have the same result, a refusal, and repeated refusals affect him, not you. For your future together, you may need to rethink your short term plans so that your long term goals are not affected negatively.

",155290,"To understand what it means, let's unpack the text of the decision.


  Sufficient justification for the purpose and circumstances of the intended stay was not provided.


That's one of the standard reasons for refusals provided in the Schengen Visa Code and other official documents. In general, it means that the consulate is not convinced you have a valid purpose for travel. There are many reasons why that might be and the rest is just an explanation of how they reached that conclusion.


  The specific purpose for which the visa was applied for is no longer valid or will cease to be valid before you arrive in the member state of destination.


This one is more specific and should help understand the first one. What this means is that the purpose for the trip you described in your original application might have been valid at some point in the past but it is not current anymore. Imagine you want to attend a conference but your application is delayed and the date of the conference has passed by the time the application is being assessed. Going to a conference is a perfectly valid purpose for a trip but if that specific conference has passed, you cannot possibly attend it and it's not a valid purpose for a visit anymore. 

It's difficult to say more without knowing more about your application but there are currently many restrictions on entry, travel and access to public areas across Europe due to the Covid-19 pandemic. So there are many legitimate trips to the Schengen area that are just not possible anymore. For example, if you applied for a visa to vacation in Italy, providing hotel bookings, etc. your trip does not have a purpose anymore as it won't be possible for you to stay at these hotels or visit any sights.


  No other (secondary) purpose was stated at the time of the application, [or] if it was, insufficient documentation was provided to demonstrate the purpose of the stay. 


A single journey can very well have several purposes. Even if one of them ceases to be valid, it doesn't mean that the trip is necessarily useless. But, in the judgment of the consular officer, you did not describe any other sufficient purpose for this journey. It could be a reference to some detail of your application or simply some boilerplate they add to all such decisions.

[Note: I changed “of“ into “or”. It makes more sense in this sentence; it could be a simple typo or a confusion with the Dutch word “of“, which does mean “or”.]

So what does it mean for you? The decision is negative, you won't get a visa and cannot travel at this time. An appeal does not seem to make sense to me so you will need to start a new application from scratch if you want to travel to the Schengen area in the future.

On the other hand, that's not the worst reason to be refused a visa. Nothing suggests the consular officer suspected that you might be lying (they can use a different phrasing - “the justification […] was not reliable” in that case) and they haven't expressed any doubt regarding your personal situation and willingness to abide by the rules. So a new application in a few months from now, when Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted, seems like it would have good chances to be successful.
",Reasonable,"It should not be a problem.

The relevant condition for applying for a Schengen visa is just that you're legally resident in the coverage area for the consulate you're applying to. It is perfectly possible to be legally resident in the USA without having a current visa, and consulates in the USA know this well.

Another possible problem is that the consulate want to be sure you can actually leave the Schengen area when you say you will. That could have been a problem if your plan was to return to the US directly, since you don't have a visa that would allow you to board a plane.

But in your case your plan is to go to India when you leave the Schengen area, and presumably you already have all the paperwork you need for that (namely, a valid Indian passport), so there's no doubt that you will be able to do so.

If problems with getting your new US visa develop, it will be after you've left the Schengen area, so that's not a risk the Schengen consulate would care about.

You will still need to show that you have plans for your future that would seem more attractive than ""stay in Europe as an illegal immigrant"", but simply documenting a well-reasoned expectation that you will get an US visa when you reach India ought to take care of that.

2 questions


Can I do a multi-day cycle tour? Mainly in the Saarland and Rheinland-Pfalz. Perhaps also Hessen. 
Can I camp in public spaces?


The questions are in the context of the Corona virus. In previous years in summer I have seen people camp out in the open along various rivers (Mosel, Rhine, Saale, Fulda). Myself I have camped in the open in the Blackforest, Erzgebirge and various other parts of Germany. But there was no Corona virus. I do not want to know if stealth / wild camping is allowed in normal times. 

I am also worried that with a touring bicycle (bags on rear and front racks), the authorities will immediately see that I am doing a tourist activity and not simply going to work.

(I am already legally in Germany.)
",155334,"TL;DR: You can, possibly, in some places, but it may not be a great idea.

Whether it is legal depends on the Bundesland (state) — to put it simply, the federal government has no authority in these matters, and each state put down their own rules. There are federal rules for entry into Germany, but these don't apply as you are already in the country.

Example rules

For example: In Saarland they implemented a lockdown (possibly due to their proximity to the heavy-hit regions of France): You may only leave your home due to ""important reasons"". On the other hand Rheinland-Pfalz has a ""contact prohibition"", which means that you can free to go wherever you want, as long as you are with no more than one other person. 

Also, individual cities have the right to be more restrictive.

Things change

Case numbers will rise in Germany and regulations may become more strict at any moment. In which case it may be difficult for you to go back home (also: Do not count on any restrictions being lifted until well after Easter — at best)

Infrastructure is shut down

However, even in Rheinland-Pfalz accommodations are not open for touristic purposes. This will include campgrounds. ""Wild"" camping is only regulated by the Länder, but generally there will be restrictions, and camping spots may be cordoned off. 

Also, most public services that are useful for travellers are also shut down.

Enforcement

It is difficult to say how things will be enforced. Generally there's no formal requirements in Germany, unlike in Italy or France. They will still stop and fine you if you blatantly flout the rules. My guess is that nobody will go and check for wild camping in the middle of nowhere, but they may check popular camping spots to make sure people don't congregate there.

Responsibility

Cycling alone is not really an (additional) risk, as long as you don't meet people. However, the question is if it is going to be a fun trip if you


can't go in places like the Saarland,
keep to yourself all the time,
have to find a remote spot to pitch your tent each night, and have no access to sanitary facilities,
have to bring/buy and cook your own food (there will be no restaurants).


Plus, Germany is a densely populated country — it will be hard to really be alone. And as soon as more than one person pitches their tent in one place, the police will likely see that as a ""congregation"" and break it up. 

In all honesty, it is probably a better idea to stay put in one place. If the local laws allow it, you can still go cycling and return to your home each night.

",156387,"She can file Form I-539 for Extension of Status at any point up until her status expires. The application just has to be officially received by USCIS before her status expires.

If she filed her Extension of Status application before her status expired, she can stay in the US while it is pending even if her status expires in the meantime. The government will generally not deport her for being out of status while her Extension of Status is pending. In addition, she does not accrue ""unlawful presence"" while her timely-filed, non-frivolous Extension of Status application is pending, even if her I-94 is expired. If her Extension of Status is approved, she will be retroactively granted status from when her last status expired.

See this brochure:


  What if I file for an extension of stay on time but USCIS doesn’t make
  a decision before my I–94  expires?
  
  Your lawful nonimmigrant status ends, and you are out of status, when
  your Form I-94 expires, even if you have timely applied to extend your
  nonimmigrant status.  Generally, as a matter of discretion, USCIS will
  defer any removal proceedings until after the petition is adjudicated
  and USCIS decides your request for extension of nonimmigrant status.
  [...]
  
  Even though you are not actually in a lawful nonimmigrant status, you
  do not accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of inadmissibility
  under section 212(a)(9)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,
  while your extension of status application is pending if it was filed
  prior to the expiration of your Form I-94.
  
  [...]
  
  If your application for an extension of stay is approved, the approval
  will relate back to the date your Form I-94 expired, and your status
  while your application is pending will then be considered to have been
  lawful.
  
  If your application is denied, you may be required to cease employment
  and depart the United States immediately.
  
  In addition, any nonimmigrant visa in your passport granted in
  connection with your classification becomes void. Once your visa is
  void, you must submit any new visa application at a U.S. consulate in
  your home country (not a third country, except in rare instances as
  determined by the U.S. Department of State).


If her timely-filed, non-frivolous Extension of Status application is denied, and her I-94 has expired, and she is still in the US on the date of the denial, she will start to accrue ""unlawful presence"" from the date of the denial. 

See AFM chapter 40.9.2(b)(3)(D)(iv):


  If a timely filed, non-frivolous request for EOS or COS is denied for
  cause, unlawful presence begins to accrue the day after the request is
  denied.


And 9 FAM 302.11-3(B)(1)(b)(4)(b)(ii):


  b. DHS has interpreted ""period of stay authorized by the Secretary of
  Homeland Security,"" as used in this context, to include:
  
  (4) For aliens who have applied for extension of stay or change of
  nonimmigrant classification and who have remained in the United States
  after expiration of the From I-94 while awaiting DHS's decision, the
  entire period of the pendency of the application, provided that: 
  
  (a) the alien does not work unlawfully while the application is
  pending and did not work unlawfully prior to filing the application;
  and
  
  (b) the alien did not otherwise fail to maintain his or her status
  prior to the filing of the application (unless the application is
  approved at the discretion of USCIS and the failure to maintain status
  is solely a result of the expiration of the Form I-94), and further
  provided either:
  
  (i) [...]; or
  
  (ii) if the application was denied or the alien departed while the
  application was still pending, that the application was timely filed
  and nonfrivolous.


""Unlawful presence"" doesn't cause a ban unless she leaves the US after accrues more than 180 days of ""unlawful presence"". So she shouldn't have to worry about a ban as long as she leaves within a reasonable amount of time after she learns about the denial.

The other consequence of her being still in the US when her Extension of Status is denied if her I-94 is expired, is that INA 222(g) is triggered, which means the visa she used to enter the US is automatically voided, and she would have to apply for US visas from her country of nationality from then on.

Also, USCIS has a policy where they will issue Notices to Appear (NTAs) to people after an I-539 denial if they are unlawfully present after the denial, although I am not sure whether they are still doing that during the COVID-19 outbreak. According to this teleconference, they will wait for a 33-day period (the period to file a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider) after the denial before they issue the NTA, so this basically means your mother should try to leave within 33 days of a denial.

On the other hand, if she leaves the US while her timely-filed, non-frivolous Extension of Status application is still pending (i.e. before it is approved or denied), she does not accrue any ""unlawful presence"", and her visa is not voided.

See AFM chapter 40.9.2(b)(3)(C):


  Departure from the United States while a request for EOS or COS is
  pending, does not subject an alien to the 3-year, 10-year, or
  permanent bar, if he or she departs after the expiration of Form I-94,
  Arrival/Departure Record unless the application was frivolous,
  untimely, or the individual had worked without authorization.


And the 9 FAM 302.11-3(B)(1)(b)(4)(b)(ii) passage quoted previously.

And it does not void her visa under INA 222(g), according to 9 FAM 302.1-9(B)(1)(c)(4)(B):


  [...] In addition, if an alien departs after the date on the Form I-94
  passes, but before his or her application for extension or change of
  status has been decided by USCIS, they must be subject to a blanket
  exemption from INA 222(g), if the application was filed in a ""timely
  manner"" and is ""nonfrivolous"" in nature.  You may consider an
  application nonfrivolous if it is not, on its face, a groundless
  excuse for the applicant to remain in the United States to engage in
  activities incompatible with his or her status.  Posts may be
  satisfied that an alien filed in a timely manner using evidence such
  as a record in USCIS Person Centric Query Service (PCQS) or the dated
  receipt or canceled check from USCIS for the payment of the
  application fee to extend or change status together with evidence of
  the expiration of the alien's legal status.


The meaning of being timely-filed and non-frivolous are described in AFM chapter 40.9.2(b)(3)(C):


  [...]
  
  The requirement that the application was timely may be established
  through the submission of evidence of the date the previously
  authorized stay expired, together with a copy of a dated filing
  receipt, a canceled check payable to USCIS for the EOS or COS
  application, or other credible evidence of a timely filing.
  
  [...]
  
  To be considered non-frivolous, the application must have an arguable
  basis in law and fact, and must not have been filed for an improper
  purpose (such as to prolong one’s stay to pursue activities
  inconsistent with one’s status).
  
  In determining whether an EOS or COS application was non-frivolous,
  DOS has instructed consular posts that it is not necessary to make a
  determination that USCIS would have ultimately ruled in favor of the
  alien.


And 9 FAM 302.11-3(B)(5)(b-c):


  b. [...] Therefore, for all cases involving potential inadmissibility
  under INA 212(a)(9)(B) whether under the three-year bar of
  212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I) or the 10-year bar of INA 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), DHS
  has decided to consider all time during which an application for
  extension of stay (EOS) or change of nonimmigrant status (COS) is
  pending to be a period of stay authorized by the Secretary of Homeland
  Security provided:
  
  (1) The application was filed in a timely manner; i.e., before the
  expiration date of the Form I-94, Arrival and Departure Record;
  
  (2) The application was ""nonfrivolous""; and
  
  (3) The alien has not engaged in unauthorized employment (whether
  before or after April 1, 1997).
  
  [...]
  
  c. To be considered ""nonfrivolous"" the consular officer must find that
  the application had an arguable basis in law and fact and must not
  have been filed for an improper purpose (e.g., as a groundless excuse
  for the applicant to remain in activities incompatible with his or her
  status).  It is not necessary to determine that the DHS would have
  approved the application for it to be considered nonfrivolous.


So the question is whether her application of Extension of Status is ""frivolous"" or not. Note that it is possible for an application to be ""non-frivolous"" even if USCIS is likely to deny it; it just needs to have an ""arguable basis in law and fact"" and not be ""filed for an improper purpose"".

In my (non-professional) opinion, an application of Extension of Status for the reason of not being able to return to her home country to due COVID-19 flight bans is not frivolous. In the USCIS page on Special Situations, it mentions that for applications of Extension of Status and Change of Status, USCIS will take into consideration how special situations prevented your departure.

156392,Getting refunded for a flight which I'll be prevented from boarding,"In 2019 I booked a flight ticket with SAS to Svalbard. Unfortunately Covid19 happened.

My ticket is from a flight outside the nordic countries, with a layover in Oslo.

I'll be prevented from entering Norway, since I'm not a resident. Moreover, even if I was already in Norway right now, I'd be prevented from boarding the flight from Oslo to Longyearbyen, since Svalbard  also separately restricted travel.

To add to the complexity, when I tried to book this ticket, SAS doesn't offer a flight with a single layover. All of the flights I found have a further layover in Stavanger, Stockholm, Copenhagen... even if SAS offers direct flights to Oslo! The solution I found was to book with a travel agent which sold me a ticket with a single layover.

So, SAS has a page for Covid19 information, with links to a search tool (a bit buggy and annoying to use) to check cancelled and confirmed flights, I haven't been able to confirm it for sure, but the closer we are to the departure date (it's less than 10 days from now), it seems that the less likely it'll be for it to be cancelled.

I have the option of REBOOKING FREE OF CHARGE, unfortunately The rebooking can be made only once. and due to the current uncertainty, it's really difficult to pick another sensible date on which to plan my trip (no idea when Norway and Svalbard will reopen to visitors).

In theory, I have the option to exchange my flight ticket for a voucher, that way I'd have the option to defer choosing the new date, which would suit me much better. Unfortunately The voucher is valid for bookings made directly with SAS (not for bookings made by travel agents).

I already contacted my travel agent 6 days ago. They ask not to call, and contact them via their ticketing system only for trips in the next 4 weeks. Unfortunately, both messages I sent them have been replied with an automated reply which suggests to call them on the phone (phone which only has a recorded message, saying that they are unable to take calls due to the huge volume of requests).

So, it seems that I'm stuck. I was thinking that given that in normal circumstances I have right to travel to norway (being an EEA citizen), if I'm denied boarding I should be able to at least hope for compensation according to EU regulation 261.  Though it seems there's an exception  For safety, security or health reasons, which usually is for different kinds of concerns, but it might be applied to a blanket ban on non-residents due to Covid19.
Regardless if that exception happens, I'd have to actually attempt boarding (be at the airport on time) to actually claim compensation. I could do that, but that seems less than ideal:


I'm social distancing, and I'd rather avoid a needless trip to the airport
As described above, I don't know if I should realistically expect compensation (maybe you can help me here)
I'd have to hope that the airline would really not let me board (given that I'd then be stuck in Norway without a flight to come back immediately), though I guess I can go past the gate and then turn back before entering the plane.


I guess that if the worst thing that happens to me during this pandemic is that I'll lose out on the money for this flight ticket, that's still pretty good, all things considered. Before giving up on it though, maybe you have some suggestion on how to able to be refunded?
",156463,"If someone has an answer to the general question, that's still welcome, but to provide an update on my specific situation:

It seems that things will resolve for the best: the airline ended up cancelling the flight, and the travel agent wrote me that they'll go ahead with the refund process.

I've actually only received automated emails from the agent, and I've been unable to speak with anyone. Otoh I've actually been able to speak with someone from the airline, so this experience is persuading me to try even harder in the future to avoid booking via a travel agent.
",Reasonable,"There is a possibility you will have to pay, as I am reading on TripAdvisor they are very strict on bags:


  Etihad is extremely strict at check in on carry on baggage size, it's weight, and also the weight of checked baggage, so much so that at Abu Dhabi there are scales and areas for passengers to re-distribute contents across bags to balance weight variations.


Also, from this question:


  Airlines do weigh checked baggage and that is the most important measurement, actual dimensions are almost never measured for 'normal' luggage. Even when they do, small differences are hardly ever a problem, especially if the overall dimensions are good.
  There is, however, no guaranty a specific agent may measure and give you a harder time.
  At this time there is no tradition of measuring luggage out of sight of the passenger and coming back to them with complains.
  
  If the rules change in the future, you might be stuck with a piece of luggage that can not be used on flights.

His visa is expired now and we are so worried about this issue. Is it possible for him to go back to Iran with an expired visa in this situation?

Under normal circumstances overstays may be punished, but for people who leave on their own after a few days that would at most be a fine. That makes the response by the border police puzzling.

The city of Munich writes:


Contact the KVR before the visa expires. He has done that.
He will receive a certification which is valid until the KVR reopens. That hasn't happened yet.

A confirmation of the hotel or host where he is staying.
A proof that departure is impossible. (They don't say what that is.)

He should take care to get everything documented properly so that there are no problems with the next Schengen visa application.

156411,Obtaining Domestic Travel Insurance During Covid-19,"We booked a holiday cottage in the UK for the end of July 2020. We neglected to purchase travel insurance when we booked it at the start of 2020 (we've learnt from this mistake). We have already started paying the balance on this trip.

So now we are looking at purchasing travel insurance but we are concerned that the Covid-19 lockdown currently in the UK, will invalidate any insurance we take out now. The optimistic estimates put the end of the lockdown around the 15th June.

Is it worth us taking out the insurance now to protect our existing deposit/holiday or is likely that all insurance policies purchased now will be invalidated if there is an extension to the lockdown?

Any guidance on this is much appreciated.
",156413,"Generally speaking it is worth considering cover now for a future trip, but it's unlikely that a standard travel insurance policy regulated by the UK will cover you for Covid-19 related problems. So far as I'm aware, none will.

Several UK insurers aren't even selling travel insurance policies for the time being.

Compare the Market says in its online quote page:


  Following the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring coronavirus as
  a pandemic on the 11th March 2020, many insurance companies will

  exclude known events from elements of the cover they offer.

  check the policy wording or contact the insurer to ensure the cover
  meets your needs.

156488,Getting refunded for a non-refundable booking due to the hotel closure because of the COVID-19 situation (Netherlands),"I made a non-refundable hotel room booking through the hotel website. The hotel is located in the Netherlands.

Two days ago, a hotel manager informed me that they close the hotel for a certain period that included the period of my stay due to the Coronavirus, and that is why they were forced to move my reservation to another date. However, I do not want to move my reservation and would like to get the money back because I did not cancel my reservation, so I informed the hotel about it. The hotel, however, states that they are forced to move my reservation to another date as I made a non-refundable booking.

I checked the official website of the government of the Netherlands as was advised here and the rules of the hotel on their website but have not found anything on this matter. The rules, however, are on Dutch, so I could misunderstand or skip something (I do not speak Dutch at all).

P.S. My sister booked the same hotel for the same dates (non-refundable hotel room booking as well) but through Booking. She was able to get a refund after several e-mails. However, she made the booking from Russia (the Netherlands deny the entry for foreigners having a tourist visa), while I did it from Germany where I have permanent residency.

They try to move the bookings, so that they have the money (liquidity) to pay employers. They could be in trouble if all clients will ask refund (there could ask government for help).

But you booking is a contract, so they are required to fulfill the contract on the data you both agreed, or they must refund you.  Just they try (maybe with a better offer) to keep booking (and money) for a later period.

The website booking.com doesn't get money from you (you will pay the hotel), so they have no really interest to have the ""move booking"" default.

So try to contact them, and think: do you want to book in a later date? In that case you may try to get a very good offer. But they must refund you.

The last step, it is to contact your credit card, and get the money back from them, because you were charged a service they will not offer you.

I have crossposted the question at:


Quora

",156493,"Assuming you want to fly home (and you should only be trying to fly home), your best bet is the consular staff of your country. For example, various Canadian government agencies are tweeting about flights to Canada from specific airports. Here's a snapshot of the feed of travel.gc.ca:



In addition to following your country (and subsets of it like the ""Canada in Lebanon"" and ""Canada in Singapore"" accounts you see in the screenshot) you should have registered with your government so they can email, call or text you, and you should probably have called your embassy or consulate for advice about how to get home. 

If you aren't trying to get home, but are trying to reach a relative or someone else who really needs you, these same sources are the ones that are likely to help you. If you think your travel need isn't urgent enough to get an embassy involved, then stop trying to travel. People are desperately trying to get home, to reunite families, to get out while they can. If you've just always wanted to see a particular place, now is not the time.

Bottom line: make sure at least one qualified human who is connected to your target country knows you're trying to get there, then start monitoring the heck out of airlines, airports, and those embassies and consulates on all the social media you can think of, and getting yourself on group chats and multi emails and facebook groups, so you'll be notified when there's a chance to go.

156517,"Air Serbia reneged on an offer of compensation, citing Covid-19. Is this OK?","Someone I know booked a return flight on Air Serbia from Vienna to Podgorica (Montenegro) via Belgrade, departing on 6 March 2020 and returning on 14 March 2020.  On 10 March 2020, Air Serbia cancelled the return leg from Belgrade to Vienna without explanation; the passenger contacted Air Serbia by phone, who rebooked them on the next available flight, 24 hours later than the original return date.  Air Serbia told them on the phone that reasonable transport, meal, and accommodation costs for the unplanned overnight stay in Belgrade would be compensated.

According to Air Serbia's statement of passenger rights*, the EU Regulation 261/2004 on flight compensation is integrated into Serbian law, so we assume that the passenger is entitled not only to the costs for the stay in Belgrade, but also €250 in compensation for the cancelled flight.

The passenger accordingly made a claim for compensation (both the overnight expenses and the €250 cancellation award) using Air Serbia's online form*, including all the relevant travel information and documentation (receipts, etc.).  Air Serbia just now rejected the claim as follows:


  Thank you for your patience while the claim relating to your journey from BEG to PRG on 14.3.2020 was processed.
  
  After carefully reviewing your claim, I regret to inform you that we are not able to provide compensation in this case. This decision was reached taking into account the specific circumstances of your case, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Please note that the decision is final.
  
  We’re sorry that our service on 14.3.2020 did not meet your expectations and hope that we can look forward to welcoming you on-board an Air Serbia flight in the future.


We are skeptical about this rejection for the following reasons:


On the phone, Air Serbia had already promised compensation at least for the transport, accommodation, and meals in Belgrade.
Air Serbia cancelled the flight before the governments of Serbia and Austria had imposed any restrictions on foreign travel relating to the coronavirus pandemic.
At no time before now had Air Serbia indicated that the cancellation was due to the pandemic.
According to the answer to another Covid-19–related question here (May I get a refund for a flight cancelled because of COVID-19?), ""under EU rules you always get a refund"".


We would therefore like answers to the following:


Under Serbian or EU law (whichever is applicable in our case), is the passenger in fact entitled to compensation in this case?
If the answer to the previous question is ""yes"", then to what enforcement body can the passenger appeal Air Serbia's final decision?  The EU helpfully provides a list of national enforcement bodies for EC 261/2004, but Serbia is not on this list.  If there's no national enforcement body in Serbia, can the passenger appeal to the one in Austria, given that she bought the ticket and is resident there?

However, extra expenses (accommodation, food) are to be reimbursed, per Article 9 of the EC261 regulation.

So contact them again and mention this (of course, attach the receipts). Tell them that Article 9 of EC261 applies regardless of any extraordinary circumstances.

And if you want to be dead certain if extraordinary cirumstances apply or not (i.e. whether or not the €250 compensation is due), ask a firm such as Claimcompass to investigate it. It costs nothing, and they have sophisticated resources for checking things, but if they find compensation is due, they'll keep 35% of the amount for themselves.

Before I was to return on March 23 to Colombia my flight was cancelled due to Colombia closing its borders including to its citizens that were traveling overseas at the time. All international flights have been canceled.  

What happens if my visa travel date expires before I can leave to go to Colombia?
",156537,"You have 3 options.


Your US entry could be still valid for a few months. Usually, an entry is valid for 6 months. You can plan to stay in US till situation is clear and flights are open to Colombia. It can be a few months.
If your entry is expiring, you can apply for an extension.
You can contact your embassy about the possibility of repatriation or any other help. Even if normal flights are not allowed, repatriation with quarantine might be possible.

",Reasonable,"You'll find details at bahn.de. Enter your planned trip and in the details section of any selected trip you'll find which track (Gleis) the train will be on.

156543,Is it possible to apply again for new extension for visa B2 due to covid?,"I requested a B-2 visa extension on September for my mother, she has to stay until may 14, so she is already 1 year in USA as a visitor, but due to covid-19 I am worry about her health, she is 74 years old, with dementia and diabetes my father is the one who takes care for her, He is citizen. Is possible to get a new extension while everything is safe here or in our country?
",156565,"To answer your question, yes, there is no limit to the number of times status can be extended during one stay (note that it is the status that is extended; visas cannot be extended, since visas are only for entry anyway), and it is possible to apply for another B2 extension of status before the current extended status expires. Of course, the chances of approval of an extension of status goes down with each additional extension. The fact that she has a US citizen spouse in the US also may make it likely that she will be denied for immigrant intent. But at least an application for extension of status (filed before her status expires) will allow her to stay while the application is pending, which can be several months, so it will buy her more time.

As some comments have noted, if she intends to keep staying in the US, it would be better for her to not apply for extension of status, and instead apply for Adjustment of Status to get a green card in the US through a petition from her spouse.

156552,How will the travel restrictions in Germany due to COVID-19 affect student visas,"On 16th March, 2020 the EU announced a 30 day travel restriction for all non-essential travel. On 6th April, 2020 Germany has announced the new updated travel restrictions to Germany. However, there is not much clarity for information about students. 

Can anybody provide information on what are the restrictions (if any) for people people who need to travel to Germany for their studies (starting summer 2020) on national visa (Type-D)? How will these restrictions affect people, who are about to come to Germany on student visa(s)?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
",156553,"At present there are to many unknowns to give a reliable answer.

Assuming that the present restrictions remain until September:


a D-Visa will be required 


which is what a Student Visa is

the Universities will be opened up in some form allowing new students to start


taking up residence would probably be considered a valid reason. 

A quarantine period of 14 days, being introduced on the 10th of April, must be fulfilled. 
",Reasonable,"Yes, you can travel to Australia with a Polish temporary passport.

Timatic, the database which airlines use to verify passenger travel documents, states in relevant part:


  Passport Exemptions:
  
  
  Nationals of Poland with a temporary passport.
  


Remember to transfer your visa to your new passport before you travel. Since you must do this anyway, you probably may as well just get the 10 year passport, unless you need to travel urgently and can get the temporary passport more quickly.

156584,Should I insist on a refund or take Ryanair's offer to move travel date free of charge?,"I bought a Ryanair return ticket from Zadar (Croatia) to Wroclaw (Poland) in February 2020, and my flight was scheduled for the middle of May. On March 21 I received an official mail that I was able to cancel my reservation and claim a full refund of the unused flight(s), and I did that. In the same mail they wrote: Refunds will be processed within 7 working days back to the form of payment used for the original booking.
That period already passed, but on March 28 I received a second mail, and this is in short the body of the message:


  Due to the high volume of flight cancellations due to COVID 19, we are experiencing an unprecedented high volume of requests. We are currently working through the backlog and ask that you please bear with us... Please do not resubmit your request.


All this time I am very patient, but today I got a third mail from Ryanair:

EDIT:

Few moments ago I received another official mail, it is very logical, and I will keep with patience...


  Dear Customer,

  booking XYZZYX
  
  As previously advised, our Customer Services Team are experiencing an
  unprecedented high volume of requests due to the COVID-19 crisis and
  we are prioritising our most vulnerable customers. This has been
  compounded by government public health restrictions on non-essential
  work travel which means we have less staff available to us during this
  busy time. Please rest assured your refund request is currently in the
  queue and will be processed. If you have selected new travel dates and
  would prefer to move your booking, please contact us
  
  We appreciate your patience at this time.
  
  Yours sincerely, Ryanair Customer Services

",156595,"With RyanAir, I would continue to insist on the refund.  If it was done on a Visa debit or credit card, I’d ask the bank to reverse it.  I suspect that will be faster than waiting for RyanAir.  But give the bank the evidence that you’re supposed to get a refund.  Otherwise, they’ll say it was a legitimate charge.
",Reasonable,"Nothing happens. If anything, it helps build the perception that you don't have immigrant intent.

An unused non immigrant visa does not cause any future immigration issues. If asked for a reason in the next interview, it is perfectly alright to mention the reasons you have listed here.

",Reasonable,"There are random checks on both buses and trains. I've had my passport checked when traveling by train from Germany to France and when traveling by bus from Austria to Germany. I also had my passport checked almost every time when traveling to Switzerland, but the last time I went there was 8 years ago.

These checks are seemingly random, and (other than Switzerland) they happened to me less than 5% of the times I traveled across borders within the EU. I suspect checks are more common on trains and buses that are suspected of carrying passengers coming from eastern Europe, but I don't know that for sure.

If you have a temporary residence permit that is valid the entire time you are traveling, then that should be good enough. It shows that you have permission to be there.

Why does one often have to check in  extra early, i.e. 3-4 hours early, before the flight departure for repatriation flights?



I have crossposted the question at:


Quora

",156612,"The additional check in time is needed for all the extra paperwork.  Repatriation flights are organized and approved by governments to help return citizens to their country of origin.  They can't let anyone on board who is simply willing to pay the fare.  They must check and double check your passport, citizenship status, etc.  Moreover, scheduling a repatriation flight is not the same as regular commercial flight operation.  The planes often arrive empty, without a regular gate to occupy, without a regular slot to fly and the whole operation can be changed at the last-minute.  If you really want to get on the flight then it's best to be there extra early to deal with the unexpected.

156640,Insurance company not paying out my curtailment claim for UK citizen returning from France on 16th March,"I had a ski trip planned from 14th March - 21st March. 
I arrived in the French ski resort at 15:00 on 14th March and by 23:00 the French government went into lock down and ordered all non-essential businesses to close immediately - including ski resorts. 

Fearing being stuck in the resort, the next morning I changed my return flight from 21st March to 16th March and had to pay extra fees.

I tried to contact my insurance company but they did not answer. I was also in a rush as my accommodation has ordered me to leave, but I do not have proof of this in writing unfortunately.

I am now trying to claim these extra fees back from my insurance company but they are stating that because the FCO (UK Govt) did not announce non essential travel until the 17th March I have no claim. 

The exact wording in my travel policy for curtailment is:


  If you have to curtail your trip as a result of the Travel Advice Unit of the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office
  (FCO), the World Health Organisation (WHO) or similar body recommending evacuation from the country or
  specific area in which you are travelling, providing the directive came into force after you purchased this
  insurance and after you have left your Country of Residence to commence the trip (whichever is the later).


And the reply from my insurance company was:


  Unfortunately, from the information you provided, it would appear as shown above, the reason you abandoned your trip is not included in the specified incidents for which cover is provided under the policy. 
  You paid the fee to amend your flight on the 15th of March, however, the FCO advice to travel to/from France came into force on the 17th of March. We are therefore unable to consider your claim further.


This is really cheeky of them and they clearly don't want to pay out. I need some advice on the fact that I was already abroad at the time of this announcement - the host country has ordered everything to close and therefore my trip will be cut short. 

What points can I argue that my policy is in fact valid and I am due a refund?
Thanks
",156642,"The wording states 


...or similar body recommending evacuation from the country



So although the FCO might not have issued advice until later, the fact that the French government ordered all resorts closed should be sufficient.

So you need to find this advice from French government sources online, write back to your insurance company and be polite but firm and point this out to them.  Keep your letter short and to the point and state that you had no choice and the country was being locked down and all non-residents ordered to leave.
Therefore, according to the T&amp;Cs of your policy you expect the claim to be honoured and paid in full ASAP.

Also point them to this statement from the Financial Conduct Authority:
https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/insurance-and-coronavirus-our-expectations

And this:
https://www.choose.co.uk/news/2020/covid-19-insurance-policy-advice-government/

State that you are disappointed with their behaviour and are considering complaining to the insurance ombudsman.  And will pursue the claim further if they do not pay.

If they still refuse, then your only option is to complain to the ombudsman and/or pursue them in the small claims court.
",Reasonable,"I got mugged when living in France. The phrase I remember them using during that experience was ""vide les poches"" (empty your pockets).

However, I'd agree with the comments on the original question, the fact that someone is trying to mug you should be apparent regardless of your competence in the language. Beggars will be persistent, sure, but it's very different to an actual ""aggression"".

156643,Can I cancel a flight because of COVID-19 and use the voucher for same time and flight cheaper ticket?,"I have booked a ticket for future travel but now see the price has come down considerably. Should I cancel because of coronavirus and rebook with voucher?
",156647,"You can't just 'cancel because of coronavirus'. If the airline is still listing the flight then you can only cancel on whatever terms you agreed to when you booked.

If your ticket is fully refundable then you can cancel and rebook, if you can actually get the refund. Many airlines are refusing to pay refunds at present. 

More likely, there will be some penalty for cancelling, which could be part or all of the fare you've paid. Even with the price reduction, it's likely that you'll end up paying more overall.

If you're hoping to get a full refund (as cash or voucher) then you'll have to wait until the airline cancels the flight, in which case there will be no flight to rebook onto.
",Reasonable,"A couple of points 
1 - unlike in France and Germany it is FREE to reserve a seat when you buy your ticket. No additional cost. If you do not get a seat you have reserved you can claim a FULL refund. The cost of your ticket therefore DOES INCLUDE A RESERVED SEAT. it's just down to you to actually reserve it
...

2 - The National Conditions of Travel are the MINIMUM standard and what all train operators have to apply. Most train operators go well beyond that and I can't think of anyone who wouldn't refund the difference in cost for first class passengers travelling in a declassified coach.

3 - yes it's a form you need to fill put but how else would you do it? it's like saying you want to return a dress and getting arsey because they want you to take it back to the shop.
